I’m not opposed to using a framework but I was hoping to go over how to implement it yourself before taking that shortcut. Not a knock on the tutorial, which is very good, but more a statement about how my mind works and how I can never finish these sorts of projects.</p>\n<p>I’ve built these types of games myself from scratch before and I know how to create all the parts. Sometimes all it takes to scratch that “time to make a game” itch is do a few tutorials and fool around.</p>\n<p>Main reasons I never finish any of these projects are I overcomplicate it from the start and I always want to keep dependencies out of it. These two tend to go hand in hand.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the journey is the point and just reading, learning and messing with the code is the important thing anyway. At least I’ll tell myself that, again.</p>\n<p> </p>\n",

Most of them are old roads now used by ATVs and snowmobiles. There are foot trails mixed in and all of it can be hiked. The trails can get wet and muddy due to these vehicles but they allow lots of wandering and creating loops in the woods.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1809.png\" src=\"https://pmcconnell.micro.blog/uploads/2022/a58702070b.png\" alt=\"IMG 1809\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>In some spots the trails are two lane superhighways through the woods. The location above had two lanes for about a half mile. I assume this is to avoid collisions but in many spots it’s so wet people have created more than two lanes.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1803.png\" src=\"https://pmcconnell.micro.blog/uploads/2022/4d1be782ad.png\" alt=\"IMG 1803\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>The roads and trails create a network of paths but there are quite a lot of signs to help navigate, though they all differ.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1808.png\" src=\"https://pmcconnell.micro.blog/uploads/2022/2b5beb0bf0.png\" alt=\"IMG 1808\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>One highlight of these woods is Twin Ponds. Two ponds hidden in the woods. The second twin and larger pond is just beyond those trees in the background on that slight rise.<img title=\"IMG_1811.png\" src=\"https://pmcconnell.micro.blog/uploads/2022/026ffe6309.png\" alt=\"IMG 1811\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>The trails are intersected at a few points by the <a href=\"https://taconichikingclub.org/taconic-crest-trail\">Taconic Crest Trail</a>. This is more of a footpath and tends to be less wet than the ATV trails. </p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1804.png\" src=\"https://pmcconnell.micro.blog/uploads/2022/bda7b58cea.png\" alt=\"IMG 1804\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Today I started off Brickyard Road just off Route 20 but I've accessed this trail network from the parking areas on Route 20 and the Pittsfield side as well. The trails extend for miles and there are many access points. Makes for interesting wandering</p>\n<p>A dreary December day. 31º with a few flurries but still no real snow.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Screenshot 2022-12-04 at 12.55.34 PM.png\" src=\"https://pmcconnell.micro.blog/uploads/2022/d9abc138ad.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022 12 04 at 12 55 34 PM\" width=\"274\" height=\"241\" border=\"0\" /><img title=\"Screenshot 2022-12-04 at 12.55.50 PM.png\" src=\"https://pmcconnell.micro.blog/uploads/2022/9368627973.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022 12 04 at 12 55 50 PM\" width=\"247\" height=\"503\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n",
