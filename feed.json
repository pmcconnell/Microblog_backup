				"content_text": "<p>After clearing the  heavy wet snow from the driveway this morning, I spent most of the day coding on a MUD. </p>\n<p>This scratches the itch to make something game-like without getting bogged down with graphics. I can get right into the parts I enjoy creating.</p>\n<p>Its fun to take yet another stab at socket programming and message parsing. It’s also rewarding to get a world up and running relatively quickly where you control all the rules.</p>\n<p>I had some old code but, as is always the case, it was bad. I don’t know what that other me was thinking. I started from scratch this time. It’s written in Go since I’ve been working with that for the day job lately and Go works well with this sort of project. Sometimes you want to learn a new language or framework and sometimes you just want to make something with comfortable tools. Today was the later.</p>\n<p>In the past I’ve created these sorts of things in the traditional way with text files for data storage but for this project I added Postgres for my storage layer. It’s overkill but the whole project is overkill. No one is going to play this but it’s fun to hack on something that’s completely of my design.</p>\n<p>Here is the world in all it’s glory after a few hours:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">look</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Room 1 - (19c4361b-f382-43e7-b708-03b5d73b3454)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The first room</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Exits: East</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Say Hello mud!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">You said 'Hello mud!'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I even took the time to create admin tools to work with the database. So I can just run migrations from my admin tool or seed the database quickly.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I worked on the code in <a href=\"https://nova.app\">Nova</a>, the Mac editor from Panic and it’s very good. It is very Mac like and extensible. While it seems most people use it for web dev there are some decent plug-ins for Go. I can do most everything I do in VS Code in Nova except debugging. I did have to swap over to VS Code a few times since its so easy to debug there. </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The best part of this project so far is getting into the flow. I find it less likely that I can get into that mental state when I’m working on a project consulting for others. It takes a lot to get up to speed and if I didn’t create the architecture or requirements I find it slows me down. When I do my own projects I am far, far more likely to just bang away and find 4 hours have passed. That’s the part of this work that is most enjoyable. When the code seemingly writes itself. If you were to stop and look over your own shoulder you would probably have no clue what is going on but the person in that trance like flow does know what’s going on and it works. </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The only downside to that state of mind is being interrupted. Even a simple question that breaks the spell can be far more irritating than it really should be.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This project amuses me and it’s in good enough shape to shelve it and come back when that inevitably happens. Of course by that time older me with think today’s me quite a silly person for some choices I made here but for now I’m content.</p>\n<p> </p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>When I know I need to get outside but I don’t know where to go, I often revisit the same places. I’ve hiked Hunter Mountain probably two dozen times. Another place I often revisit is <a href=\"https://www.dec.ny.gov/outdoor/24487.html\">North-South Lake Campground</a>. Today’s light snow made another visit to North Lake an easy pick.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1835.png\" src=\"https://pmcconnell.micro.blog/uploads/2022/a5ad466110.png\" alt=\"IMG 1835\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>The campground is located in Americas very first vacation destination and the region gave birth to one of our country’s first art movements, the Hudson River School.  Artists from the region began painting the wilderness which made this region an early destination for vacationers prior to the civil war and up until the middle of the 20th century. Naturally, people still visit this region but at it’s peak it was the destination in the young nation.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1831.png\" src=\"https://pmcconnell.micro.blog/uploads/2022/c9541d3ed8.png\" alt=\"IMG 1831\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Several grand hotels were located on the land that is now occupied by the campground and adjacent state forests. In order to cater to their visitors desires to see the Catskill wilderness a large network of trails and woods roads were created. Many of these trails remain today.</p>\n<p>These hotels and the region were so popular at their height that railroad lines were constructed to get to the hotels. The depot of the Delaware &amp; Ulster Railroad has been restored and is at the start of the <a href=\"https://townofhuntergov.com/kaaterskill-rail-trail/\">Kaaterskill Rail Trail</a></p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1819.png\" src=\"https://pmcconnell.micro.blog/uploads/2022/22da27e328.png\" alt=\"IMG 1819\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Today’s walk began at the historic train depot and follows the rail trail for over a mile before coming to Kaaterskill Falls. This is the only rail trail I’ve visited that still has many wooden ties left in place. You need to watch your step, particularly when it’s wet or icy.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1821.png\" src=\"https://pmcconnell.micro.blog/uploads/2022/cb23504478.png\" alt=\"IMG 1821\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>After about 1.5 miles the trail comes to the site of the former Laurel House Hotel and an observation platform for the Kaaterskill Falls. Over the past few years these falls have become very popular and often feel like they may be in danger of being loved to death. It’s easy to see why as you can park and walk a 1/2 mile to an amazing view.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1858.png\" src=\"https://pmcconnell.micro.blog/uploads/2022/c5df69c73b.png\" alt=\"IMG 1858\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>After leaving the falls, there are a number of trails and old roads that wander through the woods. With no particular destination in mind I followed the old rail line farther until I reached the lakes themselves.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1837.png\" src=\"https://pmcconnell.micro.blog/uploads/2022/ba634cd093.png\" alt=\"IMG 1837\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>If current conditions persist, in a few weeks the lakes will be busy with snowmobiles and ice fishermen. There was still a bit of open water today. I had the park virtually to myself, seeing only a handful of other people.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1832.png\" src=\"https://pmcconnell.micro.blog/uploads/2022/3b25595fde.png\" alt=\"IMG 1832\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>For over a century people have visited these woods and scenes like this. </p>\n<p>At the east end of the lakes is the former site of the original great hotel of the Catskills, the Catskill Mountain house. The original drive to the site remains as well as remnants of the gates and assorted out buildings</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1842.png\" src=\"https://pmcconnell.micro.blog/uploads/2022/67ca4ecef6.png\" alt=\"IMG 1842\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1840.png\" src=\"https://pmcconnell.micro.blog/uploads/2022/5e169c671d.png\" alt=\"IMG 1840\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Guests would arrive up this road to the hotel situated on a cliff overlooking the Hudson Valley. The hotel stood for 140 years before becoming a hazard and being removed with a controlled burn by the DEC in 1963.</p>\n<p>At the former hotel site, there are several displays that show what it looked like along with images of the other nearby hotels.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1846.png\" src=\"https://pmcconnell.micro.blog/uploads/2022/a18cdeb9eb.png\" alt=\"IMG 1846\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>It’s possible to visit a few hotel sites in this region and back in the woods a bit to the west of the Mountain House is the site of the Kaaterskill Hotel. That hotel is also long gone but the area still shows the old roads and foundations where it stood.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1824.png\" src=\"https://pmcconnell.micro.blog/uploads/2022/b106391c55.png\" alt=\"IMG 1824\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>It’s always great to see the woods transformed by the first snows. At some point our winters tend to overstay their welcome but in the early season it’s great to get out and just walk in the snow.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Screenshot 2022-12-11 at 5.20.23 PM.png\" src=\"https://pmcconnell.micro.blog/uploads/2022/d034419869.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022 12 11 at 5 20 23 PM\" width=\"600\" height=\"417\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Todays walk was mostly flat gaining only 470 feet over 7.9 miles of walking. It was about 28º and snowing the entire time.</p>\n<p>For an idea of how many times I’ve visited North Lake here is my GPS tracks for just the past two years. At this point I’ve covered all but a few miles of the trails in the region and many I’ve walked several times.<img title=\"Screenshot 2022-12-11 at 5.23.08 PM.png\" src=\"https://pmcconnell.micro.blog/uploads/2022/26e01e0003.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022 12 11 at 5 23 08 PM\" width=\"599\" height=\"430\" border=\"0\" /> </p>\n",

I’m not opposed to using a framework but I was hoping to go over how to implement it yourself before taking that shortcut. Not a knock on the tutorial, which is very good, but more a statement about how my mind works and how I can never finish these sorts of projects.</p>\n<p>I’ve built these types of games myself from scratch before and I know how to create all the parts. Sometimes all it takes to scratch that “time to make a game” itch is do a few tutorials and fool around.</p>\n<p>Main reasons I never finish any of these projects are I overcomplicate it from the start and I always want to keep dependencies out of it. These two tend to go hand in hand.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the journey is the point and just reading, learning and messing with the code is the important thing anyway. At least I’ll tell myself that, again.</p>\n<p> </p>\n",

Most of them are old roads now used by ATVs and snowmobiles. There are foot trails mixed in and all of it can be hiked. The trails can get wet and muddy due to these vehicles but they allow lots of wandering and creating loops in the woods.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1809.png\" src=\"https://pmcconnell.micro.blog/uploads/2022/a58702070b.png\" alt=\"IMG 1809\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>In some spots the trails are two lane superhighways through the woods. The location above had two lanes for about a half mile. I assume this is to avoid collisions but in many spots it’s so wet people have created more than two lanes.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1803.png\" src=\"https://pmcconnell.micro.blog/uploads/2022/4d1be782ad.png\" alt=\"IMG 1803\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>The roads and trails create a network of paths but there are quite a lot of signs to help navigate, though they all differ.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1808.png\" src=\"https://pmcconnell.micro.blog/uploads/2022/2b5beb0bf0.png\" alt=\"IMG 1808\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>One highlight of these woods is Twin Ponds. Two ponds hidden in the woods. The second twin and larger pond is just beyond those trees in the background on that slight rise.<img title=\"IMG_1811.png\" src=\"https://pmcconnell.micro.blog/uploads/2022/026ffe6309.png\" alt=\"IMG 1811\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>The trails are intersected at a few points by the <a href=\"https://taconichikingclub.org/taconic-crest-trail\">Taconic Crest Trail</a>. This is more of a footpath and tends to be less wet than the ATV trails. </p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1804.png\" src=\"https://pmcconnell.micro.blog/uploads/2022/bda7b58cea.png\" alt=\"IMG 1804\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Today I started off Brickyard Road just off Route 20 but I've accessed this trail network from the parking areas on Route 20 and the Pittsfield side as well. The trails extend for miles and there are many access points.

Follow the steps to hook it up and your micro.blog timeline will be sent to that newly created Mastodon account.\n\n**Option 2** - You already have a Mastodon account:\n\nYou want to cross post in this case. Go to your Micro.blog account settings and find the button to _edit feeds & cross posting_. Connect Mastodon (or twitter, etc) to your existing account. Once this is done your micro.blog posts will go to the account(s) you connected. \n\nI did both but what I really wanted was _Option 2_. I already have an account with a few followers and telling people to follow you across several accounts is not ideal.\n\nMicro.blog, once configured will allow you to follow your Mastodon friends right in your timeline. At least I've been able to add a few so far.\n\nThe only hurdle I encountered with Option 2 was Mastodon timing out several times while trying to approve access from micro.blog. It did eventually work and hopefully this all gets better once the great exodus is over.\n\nHappy to be shown what I'm still doing wrong but this seems to work.\n",
