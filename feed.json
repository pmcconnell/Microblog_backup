Download the app and give it a try.</a></p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Screenshot 2025-05-05 at 15.35.37.png\" src=\"https://pmcconnell.micro.blog/uploads/2025/simple-mapscreenshot-2025-05-05-at-15.35.37.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"702\" height=\"531\" border=\"0\" /><a href=\"https://spcartographer.app\">Cartographer</a> is a Mac application to create maps , view and edit GPS data and probably do some other mapping things I haven’t considered yet.</p>\n<p>There are many web based services that do this and if you hike, bike or do anything outdoors where you need a map and GPS you are probably familiar with them. Most of them are pretty good. All of them fall short in some area. </p>\n<p>Beyond missing niche features I had two larger issues with most of these mapping services. First was web app performance. Second is these services tend to be run by companies that may have started with the best intentions but eventually they evolve to be less than ideal keepers of our data. You’ve may have read about a few lately. Some VC firm buys out your preferred mapping service and you are left unsure of how long they will allow your app to live or who they will sell your data to.</p>\n<p>This post is mostly about getting involved in the TestFlight Beta. If you’d like to see the features of Cartographer before you get involved. <a href=\"https://spcartographer.app\">You can visit the app landing page.</a></p>\n<p><em><strong>Cartographer is a Mac app</strong></em>. That’s probably the main feature. It works like apps on your mac you already know.</p>\n<p>The original impetus for creating the app was how slow (to the point of freezing) one of the web services I was using would get if I tried to edit many waypoints. Any software developer will tell you once a tool annoys you enough you (foolishly) sit down to create your own. So I did.</p>\n<p>I’ve used several mapping apps/services over the years and they have worked pretty well to a point. Lately they keep raising their fees while not adding new functionality or even fixing long standing issues.</p>\n<p>I knew I could export my data but where did I want to put that data?  Cartographer can import GPX file data. I can now edit, create and then export all my map data on my Mac. The data stays on my Mac. If I want to share something I can but that’s my decision.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Cartographer is good to go but it’s not in any way perfect</em></strong>. It works. It works for the tasks I set out to accomplish. It may not work with things I haven’t thought of and I may have made some mistakes along the way. That’s why I’m starting a real live beta test for the app. <em>A real beta test means things are likely to be broken.</em> Things may not work in the best way because I simply didn’t think of the best way, yet. You, as a tester, can help with all this.</p>\n<p><strong>Things you can help with as a beta tester:</strong></p>\n<p>Does the app work in general for you?</p>\n<p>Refer to the help documentation and see if things make sense. Can you discover how things work browsing the docs? Did I explain something wrong? Is something not documented?</p>\n<p>Does it allow you to import GPX data as expected? If not, can you share your GPX files that are causing problems along with the name of the software/device that created the file.</p>\n<p>Can you export GPX data and import it to other apps/devices? If not let me know where this fails.</p>\n<p>You can style your locations in the map with different colors and glyphs (icons.) I know the set of glyphs is incomplete. What glyphs should be added?</p>\n<p>Do the different map overlays (styles) work for your region?</p>\n<p>You can click points on the map and have the app find a route for you. In some cases the map data lacks enough information to do so. Is the multi-mode method, mixing manual and automatic routing, working for you?</p>\n<p>If you create a path can you successfully view the elevation profile of your path? If not what region are you in? Perhaps export the path and share it with me.</p>\n<p>Do you have suggestions for new features or improvements? Share them. I have a long list of things I want to add in the future but I have not thought of everything.</p>\n<p>Report any other things you think are worth mentioning.</p>\n<p><strong>Answers to questions you may have:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Will there be an iPhone, iPad, Windows version?</em> iPhone, iPad most likely. I’d like to integrate route creation while on a hike or bike ride directly into a phone version. Not sure how much editing the phone can handle but iPad certainly could be a good platform.  Other platforms, perhaps. </p>\n<p><em>Is this app going to be free? No. </em></p>\n<p><em>Will there be a subscription?</em> Probably. This will be a paid app. Creating software while very enjoyable and rewarding is also how I earn a living. There will be a price for the app. I have not decided on the price yet or if it will be a subscription. It is likely to be a subscription to help pay for the ongoing costs of development but I’ve not made a final decision yet.</p>\n<p><em>Can you export directly to my device(s)?</em> Maybe. Let me know what devices you would like to see support for and I’ll see what’s possible. No promises.</p>\n<p><em>App X does feature A, B, C, why doesn’t yours?</em> First I need to know what the feature is then I can give a real answer but in several cases choices were made in the development of this app based on my needs as a user of the app and costs of the services required to support a feature. A good example is the elevation profile tool. If you import a GPX route it will most likely include elevation data and that data will be used to generate the profile. However, if you create a path directly in Cartographer we don’t automatically include elevation data. Elevation data requires a service to provide the elevation of each waypoint along a route. Those services are usually paid services. There are free options and we have elected to use a free service for now. The free service requests you limit your usage of the service so it can remain free. So if you really need the elevation data to view a profile you can select the “fetch” option to get the data. We don’t get it on creation of the path because you may not need or want it and it saves load on the elevation service. If the app gets traction and makes enough income to warrant use of a paid service I am more than open to that. </p>\n<p><em>You’re going to charge for this app so why not pay these services so I can have feature A, B, C?</em> Many of these services require monthly contracts whether you use the service or not. The sad truth of indie app development is most projects don’t make much (any) money. It’s a constant struggle between how much to invest in a project versus the likely return.  I would be very happy to add more features that add costs on my end if the app develops a following (i.e. paid users)</p>\n<p><em>You say other apps are missing features but surely yours is as well?</em> Of course. This is just a first version of a tool I saw a personal need for and figured others may make use of it. Will it do everything? No. Can it continue to improve, adding features over time. I hope so.</p>\n<p><em>How do I report issues or make suggestions?</em> The way that I am most likely to see feedback quickly is via the feedback option in the Cartographer help menu. This will send an email. You can include screenshots or attach files if they help explain the issue. You can report feedback via TestFlight but I don’t get any notification when new feedback is available so it may not immediately come to my attention. In the end I’m grateful for the feedback so use whichever method is better for you.</p>\n<p><strong>You didn’t ask but...</strong></p>\n<p>As an indie developer I try to limit my exposure to third party services and tools during development. I’ve been at this long enough to know that choosing the wrong dependencies can kill your app. Should I add support for feature X using service ABC? What if service ABC goes out of business? Is my app dead? I prefer to do as much as I can myself and rely on the most solid foundations.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification\">Enshitifcation</a> is real. We see once great tools killed by feature bloat or corporate greed every week. This is why I prefer native, reasonably scoped tools. These are the things I try to create. If you need a mapping app that is a social network there are other tools available.</p>\n<p><strong>Tech Stuff</strong></p>\n<p>Cartographer is a Mac Application written in Swift using SwiftUI. It is not the iPad app running on your Mac. I have no problem with those types of apps and several of my other apps use that technology.</p>\n<p>The map view itself <em>not</em> the SwiftUI MapKit version as that still lacks the features necessary for an app of this type. If you have other tech questions I’m happy to answer them. Hit me up on Mastodon.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>My ongoing app project, Cartographer, uses SwiftData for its backing store. Before shipping I knew I needed to get a better grasp on how migrations are handled with SwiftData. I have a long roadmap of features I want to be able to add over time and I needed to be sure I have a handle on how my data models could evolve over time.<img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Cartographer Screenshot.png\" src=\"https://pmcconnell.micro.blog/uploads/2025/596f294aad.png\" alt=\"Cartographer Screenshot.\" width=\"649\" height=\"522\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Cartographer is a native MacOS application using SwiftUI. It allows viewing and editing GPS data. You can plan future trips or review past adventures. I created the app to help generate data for some of my other map based app projects and to reduce my reliability on third party, mostly web based, tools. I’m also focusing on you owning your own data and privacy but that’s for another post.</p>\n<p>The two main data models for Cartographer are Locations and Paths. Each also has a relationship to a Waypoint that holds the information necessary to locate the item on the map such as latitude and longitude. A Location will have a single Waypoint while a Path will store a series of Waypoints to trace a route.</p>\n<p>Since the earliest iterations of the app, I’ve provided a Group as a way to organize collections of Locations and Paths. Say you are planning a multi-day trip and you want to break it up into several Paths, one for each day, and specific Locations along your route. You can place all these Paths and Locations into a Group to quickly display on the map all the data associated with the Trip you are planning.</p>\n<p>In SwiftData terms the Locations and Paths have a Relationship to a Group. A Location (or Path) can belong to one Group and Group can have many Locations.<em> I elected to call my Group objects AnnotationGroup so as to not be confused with a SwiftUI Group.</em> The Location Model looked something like this:</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"LocationModel.png\" src=\"https://pmcconnell.micro.blog/uploads/2025/simple-maplocationmodel.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1022\" height=\"200\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p><em>(side note: I had to add Hashable conformance for the Model to stop Xcode from complaining about the Model not conforming to Hashable. Prior to this addition I would have to compile twice in order to get this error to go away so I added this declaration and the problem stopped. Go figure)</em></p>\n<p>This is not the entire model definition and a similar setup was used for Paths. This was fine and worked as expected. Later on in the development process I realized that a one Group per Location/Path relationship was not ideal. What if I want to use a Location in many Groups? I knew I needed to update my models in order to reflect this change.</p>\n<p>Since I was using SwiftData, the backing store (where the data lived) was on my Mac and changes to the Model definitions in my code (the Schema) would  cause errors upon launching the app. The app did not know what to do with the old data that didn’t match the new Schema. Up until this point if I changed a model I just deleted the data files and started over.  The default SwiftData app template will create a ModelContainer for you that stores it’s data at a path something like this:</p>\n<p><em>/Users/&lt;your_user_name&gt;/Library/Containers/&lt;your_apps_bundle_id&gt;/Data/Library/Application Support</em></p>\n<p>Within that directory you will find three files named:</p>\n<p><em>default.store</em><br /><br /><em>default.store-shm</em><br /><br /><em>default.store-wal</em><br /><br />These three files contain your apps data and the configuration needed to work with that data. If you are just beginning your project and frequently updating the models it’s fine to just delete these three files and start fresh any time you make a breaking change.</p>\n<p>The default app template using SwiftData will provide you with a typical ModelContainer setup and a Model to use. As you develop your app you will add more Models and in turn add them to the ModelContainer schema. This works fine during development or if the app you are building is not likely to have Schema changes once you are done. </p>\n<p>In the real world for more than a tutorial app or a quick throwaway project, you are likely to need to continue to revise your Schema updating the Model definitions and migrating old data into a new Schema. If you’ve done work with a database backend before you know the drill.</p>\n<p>Your users will not want to delete their old data and start over each time you update your app. You are going to need to migrate older data into your newer formats.</p>\n<p>There are Apple Developer videos that explain working with SwiftData. They allude to Migration strategies but for the most part the content provided is not very deep. These are valuable learning tools to get started with SwiftData and you should certainly review these videos.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10187\">Meet SwiftData</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10195\">Model Your Schema with SwiftData</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10196\">Dive Deeper Into SwiftData</a></p>\n<p>These videos and associated sample code will get you started working with SwiftData and handling simple data migrations across schemas. There are other tutorials and blog posts out there that more or less repeat the information in these Apple videos. There is nothing wrong with any of these resources except they leave out some details.</p>\n<p>In most non-trivial applications it’s up to you as the developer to take the frameworks, documentation and sample code in and come up with your own ways to use them in solving your problems.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Unfortunately when it comes to SwiftData Migrations the documentation is all but non-existent</strong></em>.</p>\n<p>There are pages in the Apple Developer Docs that correspond to the required Structs needed to handle Migration but no relevant information is provided beyond the Struct or Method signatures. You will need to review the Videos, etc I’ve mentioned and do your own trial and error to get up to speed. Further, most samples and tutorials are trivial examples and solving real world problems will require trial and error.</p>\n<p>I’ve done some trials and made some errors and here is what I’ve learned. I don’t claim any of this is the correct way to do things but it worked for me and may be helpful to others.</p>\n<p>In the standard template Xcode uses for apps using SwiftData, a ModelContainer is configured and created for you. This configuration can be tailored a bit to make some changes such as how and where to store the data but you generally are unlikely to need to do much more than add your models to the schema. A typical ModelContainer might be defined as follows:</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"DefaultContainer.png\" src=\"https://pmcconnell.micro.blog/uploads/2025/simple-mapdefaultcontainer.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"945\" height=\"442\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>You can include all your Models in the schema but SwiftData is clever enough to add any related Models automatically. So in my case I can omit specifying Waypoint and AnnotationGroup Models as they are inferred by the Relationships defined in the Location and Path Models. Feel free to include them if you like but it’s not needed. I tend to include all my Models so I don’t need to think about it but I’ve left them out here for brevity.</p>\n<p>The default ModelContainer setup defines the Schema including what models are to be stored, how to configure the store and then returns the container. You can create more than one container to store different Models or different configurations for different use cases but this is the default setup the Xcode template provides.</p>\n<p>You might create a ModelContainer that is only used in Previews, for example, and you may change the `<em>isStoredInMemoryOnly</em>` setting to true as the Preview data is ephemeral and not required to be persisted.</p>\n<p>You then create Classes for each data type or Model you need. Using the @Model macro is enough to tell SwiftData that the Class is a data model. You can then use other SwiftData macros to specify things like Uniqueness and Relationships among the Model data.  </p>\n<p>You can do all this and have a working SwiftData application without any concern for Migrations. Then one day you realize you need to make a breaking change that will require migrating data from an old format to a shiny new format.</p>\n<p>In order to define how your data is transitioned from one schema to another you create versioned Schemas and a Migration Plan. I’ve used the term Schema throughout this article thus far but for the most part it’s just a specification of how your Models are defined from one version to another. </p>\n<p>In my app, as I’ve explained earlier, I wanted to change the Relationship between a Location or Path so that each could belong to one or more Groups. This is called a Many to Many relationship. A Location may belong to many Groups <em>and</em> a Group may contain many Locations. It’s easy to define these relationships in your models. Just specify that the relationship is an Array of the desired type. In my case the updated Model looked something like this:</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"UpdatedLocation.png\" src=\"https://pmcconnell.micro.blog/uploads/2025/simple-mapupdatedlocation.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1022\" height=\"222\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>The only change here is that the earlier version defined a Group (singular) Relationship and here the Relationship is to Groups (plural) and those are defined as an Array of Annotation Group.</p>\n<p>This would work just fine if I had no existing data.  I already created a bunch of Locations and Paths in the old format and I don’t want to recreate all that data to work with this new Schema.  If I was to run my app after making this change the app would crash with errors mentioning it didn’t know what to do with a Group, etc. The solution appears simple, I just need to take the old data and for each group a location belonged to insert that group into the new groups and carry on. Simple.</p>\n<p>So I will need a new versioned Schema with this updated Model definition. Again, simple.</p>\n<p><em><strong>But wait I don’t even really have a versioned Schema for the original definition. I just used the default Model Container and defined a few models. How do I get from that to this new world of versioned Schemas?</strong></em></p>\n<p>That part isn’t difficult either but like a lot of development work it’s a bunch of cutting and pasting and typing. It goes with the job.</p>\n<p>To create a Versioned Schema you define an enum for the schema. In this enum you include the version, what models are covered and the Model definitions themselves.</p>\n<p><em>Wait I have to move my Models into this new enum?</em> Yes. I don’t like i either. My Models contain a bunch more code not shown here and most of it doesn’t directly relate to SwiftData and what it needs.</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you are not terribly concerned with how your code is organized in your project or on disk feel free to skip this next bit. It’s a me problem but perhaps it’s a you problem too?</strong></em></p>\n<p>For example I have many @Transient properties to help with data presentation in the app. If you are not familiar with the @Transient macro, it essentially tells SwiftData you don’t need to be concerned with persisting this (i.e. dynamic properties.)  <em>Do I need to copy all that into this new versioned Schema?</em></p>\n<p>It turns out you don’t. You can if you wish but you don’t need to include the entire Model definition within the versioned Schema. You do need to include the base Model definition along with any stored properties and at least one init definition. You can then create an extension of the Model that may include other helpful code. Of course if any of that helpful code will need to be versioned it will need to be in this versioned Schema. I dislike the idea of of all my models being in this single enum so I’ve left a bunch of it defined as extensions of the Model stored in its own file within the project. You may not be as offended by this huge enum definition and if you are not, feel free to copy and paste your entire Model(s) into the enum. <em><strong>If you are in doubt just copy the entire Model into the new VersionedSchema.</strong></em></p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"VersionedSchema.png\" src=\"https://pmcconnell.micro.blog/uploads/2025/simple-mapversionedschema.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"843\" height=\"398\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>A typical VersionedSchema will define the version using a semantic numbering system (line 2) but the driving definition for use of the Schema is actually the enum type itself as we’ll see. You then specify what Models are included in the Schema and define the Models. Yes you have to include a minimum of a complete SwiftData Model definition for <strong>each</strong> model. If you have 10 Models you will have 10 classes defined within this enum.  And yes, you will need to repeat these Model definitions for each version of your Schema. None of this is difficult but it is a code maintenance issue and for those of us who try not to repeat the same code over and over it can be a bit painful. The reasons should be obvious but we don’t have to like it.</p>\n<p>In SwiftData Migration terms, I want to Migrate from SchemaV1 to SchemaV2. I will need to define each schema version in a VersionedSchema as shown above. </p>\n<p>Once you have the Schemas defined you need to define the Migration Plan.</p>\n<p>A SchemaMigrationPlan is just what it sounds like, a plan on how the data is to be migrated from one Schema to another (or more.) A base SchemaMigrationPlan looks something like this:</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"SchemaMigrationPlan.png\" src=\"https://pmcconnell.micro.blog/uploads/2025/simple-mapschemamigrationplan.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"721\" height=\"398\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Again it’s defined as an enum and again the enum type will be important later. You specify which Schemas this Migration Plan is using and what stages to include.</p>\n<p><em>What is a Stage?</em> A stage is a two step process that will be executed when the Migration is run. In the example above, I define migrateV1toV2 as a MigrationStage. You can have more than one stage but this is already confusing enough. Actually, you may think of reasons to have multiple stages. I didn’t use that ability.</p>\n<p>In defining a MigrationStage you indicate the starting Schema (fromVersion) and the end Schema (toVersion). Then two different closures will be called when your Stage is executed: <strong>willMigrate</strong> and <strong>didMigrate</strong>. Each closure will be provided a modelContext so you can manipulate your models and data as needed. Sounds good.</p>\n<p><strong><em>What does that mean?</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>WillMigrate is called first and will be provided with the ModelContext for the first schema</strong>. This may seem obvious and clearly it is self evident as the documentation for this method is completely empty in Apple’s Documentation. Sigh. You are given your old data in a Model Context. You can then make changes to that data if it makes sense or otherwise get a hold of the old data for use in the new context later. WilMigrate is called, as its name implies, <em>before any migration has occurred</em>.</p>\n<p>For example a few of the tutorials make note of adding uniqueness to a property that was not originally unique. Let’s say you have a name field and it’s a String. It’s possible prior to adding the Unique macro that users created non-unique names. When you are provided the context in the willMigrate closure you can then update any names that collide and write new values. If the new Schema still includes the name property this updated data will migrate across just fine with the new values.</p>\n<p>Refer to Apple's Developer Videos for a more detailed explanation of this type of migration.</p>\n<p>You don’t need to make any changes to any Models or properties that don’t change. My initial thinking was I needed to rewrite each old model into the new model format. You don’t need to do anything of the sort. In an increasingly rare instance these days of “it just works”, it just works. You only need to change things that won’t survive the migration. </p>\n<p><em>What sort of things won’t survive or work with an automatic migration?</em> Well in my example a change in a Relationship from a single to a many type won’t just work. If you recall from way earlier (and kudos for still reading this. Thanks!) I can “just” copy the old Group value and insert that into the new Groups property. Done. Not so fast. I only have the single context provided here and that context is the old Schema context that knows nothing about the fancy new Schema and it’s Groups (many to many) relationship. <strong>I can’t just do something like</strong>:</p>\n<pre>newLocation.groups.insert(oldLocation.group)</pre>\n<p>Though I sure wish I could.</p>\n<p><strong>Here is where I will discuss what I did along with another concept that should achieve the same result in a different manner.</strong></p>\n<p>As mentioned the willMigrate and didMigrate each receive a different context to work with. Basically they do as they are labeled. Prior to SwiftData performing the initial migration (willMigrate) of all the things it can do automatically you are given access to the old data and can manipulate it or as I said perhaps hold on to portions of it to be reused with the new context in didMigrate.</p>\n<p>So I’ll just declare some var to hold on to this data and read those values later. Here is another thing that feels a bit like a code smell. You can’t define any vars in your MigrationPlan or VersionedSchemas so you need to make them global. Not ideal. However, I feel that for the limited lifetime of a migration this is not the worst thing and all “rules” are made to be broken if not bent a little.</p>\n<p>I ended up defining a Class to hold the old data and an array of that Class to write from willMigrate and be read from didMigrate.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"GroupItems.png\" src=\"https://pmcconnell.micro.blog/uploads/2025/simple-mapgroupitems.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"721\" height=\"332\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>This simple Class holds all the Locations and Paths that correspond to a Group with a specified ID. Seeing it in use may help explain. <em><strong>(Line 13 begins with a tribute to Modern Swift Concurrency to appease the compiler, praise Jobs.)</strong></em></p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"WillMigrateGroupItems.png\" src=\"https://pmcconnell.micro.blog/uploads/2025/simple-mapwillmigrategroupitems.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1017\" height=\"200\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"LocToGroupItem.png\" src=\"https://pmcconnell.micro.blog/uploads/2025/simple-maploctogroupitem.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"976\" height=\"200\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Here is a portion of the willMigrate closure that creates a GroupItem for each group. When we iterate over each Location and Path later in the willMigrate closure we insert the Location or Path into the appropriate GroupItem. <strong><em>This happens in willMigrate where we have the original ModelContext (i.e. the old data)</em></strong></p>\n<p>If you’ve followed thus far you can see where this is going. In <em><strong>didMigrate (with the new ModelContext)</strong></em> we then write all the data needed to setup the relationships for Locations and Paths to their associated Groups.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"didMigrateGroupItems.png\" src=\"https://pmcconnell.micro.blog/uploads/2025/simple-mapdidmigrategroupitems.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1022\" height=\"464\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>The missing piece to put this all together is telling SwiftData to use this Migration Plan. This is done in your ModelContainer initialization. If you specify a migationPlan it will be executed prior to the container being created (line 2 below.) So all that magic (and tedious data manipulation) we outlined above will happen and your old data will be safe and sound in its new Schema home.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"MigrationPlanContainer.png\" src=\"https://pmcconnell.micro.blog/uploads/2025/simple-mapmigrationplancontainer.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"915\" height=\"112\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>As you add migrations you can continue to extend your migrationPlan. Keep in mind a user may have data from version 1.0 of your app and you have created several new schemas. The Migration Plan will need to assume always beginning with the first version.</p>\n<p>This all works as expected. My old data has been migrated and the new data is correct. Each Group still have the correct Locations and Paths and now Locations and Paths can be added to multiple groups.</p>\n<p>I was content with this solution. There is too many repetitive definitions of Models and a lot of boilerplate code but in the end the actual working parts are not too bad.</p>\n<p><em><strong>A few hours after I had all this working it dawned on me that this could be done another way. </strong></em></p>\n<p>An alternate Migration Plan could use 3 Schemas. SchemaV1 is the original with only the single relationship Group. SchemaV2 would include BOTH Group and Groups. SchemaV3 would remove the original Group relationship. In SchemaV3 when you were given the ModelContext in willMigrate both properties would exist and you could read from Group and insert into Groups. Then when the migration was completed the original Group field would be dropped leaving only the new Groups.</p>\n<p>I believe this would work and perhaps this is what <strong><em>Apple intended and I’m sure they will document some best practices around this any day now.</em></strong></p>\n<p>Is the alternate a better solution? I’m not sure.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind all the repetitive code you need to write for each VersionedSchema. Is that better than use of a global var to hold some temporary data? It wasn’t enough for me to redo my migration so it lives on as the version outlined here. Perhaps in another migration I will try the alternate way but I’m really allergic to that much repeated code. We’ll see.</p>\n<p><strong>Some additional thoughts: </strong></p>\n<p>Don’t start with VersionedSchemas when you’re just beginning your app development. It’s fine to tweak your models, delete the old data and carry on.</p>\n<p>It’s a good idea to create Git Branches with the original schema and any newer versions as you work through your migration journey. You are unlikely to get things correct the first few times and being able to load back up the old schema may prove handy.</p>\n<p>Backup the data stores (those default.store files) before you start making changes. Then you can always restore them rather than creating test data for your migration. </p>\n<p>You will find that your Models now have type names such as SchemaV1.MyModel and in my case I put all these types into a Persistence Struct so I had to reference <em>Persistence.CartographerSchemaV1.Location</em> rather than just Location. The solution is to use a typealias such as:</p>\n<pre>typealias Location = Persistence.CartographerSchemaV2.Location</pre>\n<p>Keep in mind that while you are working thru your migrations this may confuse you a bit depending on the context you're working in. The point is once the migrations are all working your code can go back to referring to Location rather than the fully qualified type name. Remember to update your typealias as you add new Schemas.</p>\n<p>You can create reverse migrations, to go from V2 to V1 for example, if you have that need. I just kept deleting my data an importing some old format data when I needed to revert during the process.</p>\n<p><em><strong>I’m hardly an expert here. I had to solve a problem and found the existing documentation lacking. Nothing I read was wrong but as is often the case it didn’t provide the full picture. I tried things until I found what worked. I’m not claiming I sat down and wrote the code you see here. It took iteration. It’s complex stuff but when broken down into its parts it’s not too bad.</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>I’ve joked along the way about Apple and their documentation and those jabs are </strong></em><b><i>warranted. The documentation is all but non-existent. Still SwiftData and these Migrations are a good system.

I don’t expect this explanation of SwiftData Migrations to be directly applicable to your apps data models but hopefully it provides more insight into how Migrations work and provides new ways of thinking when it’s time for you to deal with Migrations. </p>\n<p>As always if you have questions or comments reach out on <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@patrickmcconnell\">Mastodon</a></p>\n<p>Even better, If you are looking for help with your Apple Development Projects then get in touch.

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>Apple's MapKit provides some great tools to add maps to your Mac or iOS apps. Unfortunately, it may not provide all the features you need.  SwiftUI has its own implementation of MapKit but it’s missing a lot that is still available in UIKit/AppKit. Something both implementations share is the inability to export or print an image of your map showing any markers or tile overlays. </p>\n<p>For my current MacOS app project I’m making use of a lot of overlays and annotations so I’ve elected to use MKMapView via <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/nsviewrepresentable\">NSViewRepresentable.</a> If you’re not familiar with <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/nsviewrepresentable\">NSViewRepresentable</a>, it allows using AppKit views in your SwiftUI projects. If you need the (mostly) full features of MapKit you will need to revert to the older AppKit/UIKit implementations.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Cartographer Screenshot.png\" src=\"https://pmcconnell.micro.blog/uploads/2025/simple-mapcartographer-screenshot.png\" alt=\"Cartographer Screenshot.\" width=\"649\" height=\"522\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>My app, Cartographer, is a GPS data viewer/editor. It allows you to create maps with paths and locations. You can import or export data from GPX files, a standard GPS exchange format.</p>\n<p>Many people just import GPX data into their favorite map device such as an iPhone or Garmin. The paths and waypoints are displayed on a map on the device and you can use the information for navigation.</p>\n<p>But what if you want to share your map as an image or even print it for some real old school navigation?  Not to mention paper maps don’t need cell service or batteries. This is one of the areas where MapKit falls short. </p>\n<p>SwiftUI offers <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/imagerenderer\">imageRenderer</a> to generate an image from a SwiftUI View. if you’re working with SwiftU’s MapKit implementation, you may think you can just call that and you're all set. Unfortunately imageRenderer won’t work with complex views such as Webviews and MapViews.</p>\n<p>If you’re working with older MapKit implementations, as I am, you might try to use some code to just convert your view to an image and export or print that. That will work. <em>Sorta</em>. Depending on how you try to convert your mapView to an image you will get different results all of which fall short. </p>\n<p>If your map uses tile overlays to display custom map types, such as topographic maps, you may or may not get an image that includes those overlays. If you are displaying any kind of map Annotations they will not be included in your image.</p>\n<p>While this is frustrating the reasoning makes some sense. You will notice that if you zoom in/out on your map that the map and any overlays (tile or others like polylines) will scale to your maps zoom level. Markers will always remain the same size and be anchored to the map locations they are associated with. This is good and the expected behavior.</p>\n<p>However the way the MapKit framework achieves this is by storing the Annotations in a separate subview. That subview will not be rendered if you try to convert the mapView to an image.</p>\n<p>I want to export the map view as it appears in app. Users expect that and anything less is not worth shipping.</p>\n<p>With some digging in Xcode’s debugger I was able to determine the view hierarchy for a MapView. </p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"View hierarchy.png\" src=\"https://pmcconnell.micro.blog/uploads/2025/simple-mapview-hierarchy.png\" alt=\"View hierarchy.\" width=\"847\" height=\"318\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Using Xcodes View Debugger you can see that a MKMapView has a few container subviews. For reasons unclear to me the method I’m using to generate a map image will include the map overlays but not the markers. I assume this is due to the previously mentioned scaling of the map content.</p>\n<p>We can see that there is an MKAnnotationContainerView. This seems like a likely candidate to hold the annotations displayed on our map. </p>\n<p>From there we can see the handful of views that build up the marker. At first I thought I would have to manually draw or composite the marker bubble and the associated glyph for each marker onto the map image I was generating. Then I thought if I can just create an image from the entire MKAnnotationContainerView I could composite that over the map image and be done. Turns out, that works.</p>\n<p>This is how I accomplished the generation of an image from a map view. It’s a bit of a hack and could break as it relies on grabbing subviews of the map view based on their index. Apple could change or break this at any time but the MapKit framework is pretty mature and I feel somewhat safe shipping this.  Most importantly this solution doesn’t make use of any private framework items so it should be fine to ship.</p>\n<p>The first piece of the puzzle I’ve been alluding to is creating an image from a view. There are several ways to accomplish this but this is the one I’ve used in my app.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"asImage.png\" src=\"https://pmcconnell.micro.blog/uploads/2025/simple-mapasimage.png\" alt=\"asImage method\" width=\"749\" height=\"492\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>This creates an extension on NSView (you can use these same methods for iOS, just swap in the UIView equivalents) I created the extension on NSView and not MKMapView as the container view for the annotations is a different type and it’s not publicly exposed so Swift will balk if you try to extend that.</p>\n<p>This code takes any NSView or subclass and generates a NSImage from it. Passing a MapView will result in an image of the map as it appears in your app but it will be missing any Annotations. As I said earlier, this method will create any overlays including tile overlays. So in my usage, this creates an image with the custom tile overlays and any paths currently in view.</p>\n<p>That’s a good start but what about the markers? Since the MKAnnotationContainerView is a subclass of NSView we can just use the same method to generate a second image that contains only the annotations. Luckily for us, the MKAnnotationContainerView is the same size as the underlying mapView so it makes it trivial to composite the marker image over the map image.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"imageRep.png\" src=\"https://pmcconnell.micro.blog/uploads/2025/simple-mapimagerep.png\" alt=\"imageRep Method\" width=\"732\" height=\"456\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>This extension on MKMapView will return an image that is an accurate depiction of the current map including all annotations and overlays. It does make assumptions that mapView.subview[1] is the annotation container but that appears to work.</p>\n<p>so now a call to</p>\n<pre>mapView.imageRepresentation()</pre>\n<p>will return an image that you can then print or export.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"mapImage.png\" src=\"https://pmcconnell.micro.blog/uploads/2025/simple-mapmapimage.png\" alt=\"map image\" width=\"366\" height=\"354\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>No that's not a screenshot, thats an image generated from the map. Nice.</p>\n<p>Hope this is helpful to others. Any comments/suggestions for better ways are welcome. Hit me up on Mastodon. </p>\n",

				"title": "Refactoring SwiftUI Views, Generics and Is This Really Better?",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>I’m currently building a mapping app for MacOS using SwiftUI, codenamed <strong><em>Cartographer</em></strong> for now. There have been some struggles but currently it’s going well. I’m enjoying really digging into my tasks and taking the time to make things right.<img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Cartographer Screen Shot.png\" src=\"https://pmcconnell.micro.blog/uploads/2025/simple-mapcartographer-screen-shot.png\" alt=\"Cartographer Screen Shot.\" width=\"1132\" height=\"871\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>One of the things I’ve been doing is refactoring any views down to manageable chunks. Not only does this avoid the compiler errors where Xcode complains it’s taking too long but more importantly it helps me reason with my own code.</p>\n<p>My app allows users to create locations and paths on the map. The locations are MapKit custom markers and the paths are Polyline overlays. A user can also arrange these annotations into groups to create some order if they desire.</p>\n<p>A recent task was creating a view to display all the annotations in the map and allow the user to select any or all of them to be exported to a GPX file.</p>\n<p>I wanted a view to show all the exportable items and allow the user to pick the items to be exported. I settled on a TabView with each annotation type being a distinct tab. It looks like this right now:</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"export select dialog.png\" src=\"https://pmcconnell.micro.blog/uploads/2025/3c56e0642b.png\" alt=\"Export select dialog\" width=\"480\" height=\"419\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Each tab has a list for its content where the list displays all the exportable locations, paths or groups. A user can click on any item to select it for export. List selection is handled with a Set&lt;some exportable&gt; to allow for multiple selection. It looks something like this:</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"tabView.png\" src=\"https://pmcconnell.micro.blog/uploads/2025/simple-maptabview.png\" alt=\"Exportable TabView\" width=\"1548\" height=\"1704\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>The key thing here in starting to reduce the code repetition was the <em>updateSelections</em> method. This generic method takes some sort of element and a Set of the same element types and adds or removes the item as needed. By making this method generic I’m able to use it whether the Tab is selecting Locations, Paths, Groups or Widgets. It doesn’t matter. </p>\n<p>Eventually this dialog grew to be many lines of code and I wanted to refactor each tab out to its own view. I started cutting and pasting and things were great but my first attempt had me recreating the generic method to updateSelections to a more specific version for each annotation type. So each tab had its own version of the updateSelections method. This felt wrong-ish.</p>\n<p>I made a few attempts to get the code working so that one of my custom TabViews could accept the generic closure as a parameter and I could continue to use this generic version of the updateSelections method. My first few attempts were wrong but I did get this working and it looks something like this:</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"LocationsTab.png\" src=\"https://pmcconnell.micro.blog/uploads/2025/simple-maplocationstab.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1498\" height=\"1272\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Notice the LocationsTab takes a closure parameter defined (Location) -&gt; Void. This seems counterintuitive but this is correct and will accept the generic updateSelections method when passed in. Where is the &lt;T&gt;? It’s not necessary. The method being passed in is still a generic but it meets the criteria for this closure.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"LocationsTab Usage.png\" src=\"https://pmcconnell.micro.blog/uploads/2025/simple-maplocationstab-usage.png\" alt=\"LocationsTab Usage.\" width=\"1902\" height=\"1020\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>This partial code listing shows the Sets that track the selected items and how the LocationsTab is called in the TabView. This still calls the original generic updateSelection() method. Note that the location selections set has to be passed as  <em>&amp;self.locationsToExport</em> due to the way mutable properties are handle in the generic method.</p>\n<p>Is this actually better than just having different methods in each custom TabView? I’m not sure. I <em>think</em> it’s legible enough and easy enough to reason with or I would just write the three separate methods.</p>\n<p>I have looked at making each custom TabView more generic so you could pass in all the parameters for the different annotation types but I think that may just be too much. Some times the code gets too general purpose and it’s difficult to reason with what it’s actually doing. Sure it would be clear it’s displaying a list of things to select but I think in this case it’s worth having all the context that comes from being a little less than a general view type. Maybe I’m wrong but I think there is a point of over optimization where you can’t read/reason with your code and I’d like to avoid that.</p>\n<p>I thought this was interesting enough to share. This is all a work in progress and likely to change many more times but as of today this is where I am.

In many cases they feel like a reasonable amount of syntactic sugar, making my code more concise and I <em>hope</em> more legible. I can see where they could be overused so I’m going slow.</p>\n<p>If you are not aware Swift allows you to declare your own <strong><em>subscripts</em></strong> to access collection members. You can always use <strong><em>filter, first</em></strong>, etc on your collection but with <em><strong>subscript</strong> </em>your code may read better. </p>\n<p>Let’s say you have a Observable DataService with a property of Locations containing an array of places to display on a map.</p>\n<pre>@Observable class DataService {<br />    var locations: [Location] = []</pre>\n<p>Without subscripts you might add a method to get a specific location by searching for it’s ID:</p>\n<pre>func location(forID id: String) -&gt; Location? {}</pre>\n<p>Then elsewhere in your code you can call that method and work with the location.</p>\n<pre>let loc = service.location(forID: id)</pre>\n<p><strong><em>Subscripts</em></strong> provide the same function but you may prefer the simple format when using them:</p>\n<pre>let loc = service.locations[id]</pre>\n<p>It’s virtually the same thing as calling your method but I think it reads well and makes the code easier to reason with.</p>\n<p>Assuming you want to call the subscript on the location array, the <strong><em>subscript</em></strong> for that usage might look something like this:</p>\n<pre>extension Array where Element == Location {<br />    subscript(id: String) -&gt; Location? {<br />        self.first(where: {$0.id == id})<br />    }<br />}</pre>\n<p>Notice we placed the subscript in an extension on an array. If you define the subscript right in your DataService you would need to call it as <strong><em>service[id]</em></strong> and that may not be as clear as <strong><em>service.locations[id]</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>I try to go slowly if and when I adopt new Swift features. The curmedgeon in me thinks that so much of it just adds unnecessary complexity and often I find myself looking at recent Swift code “improvements\" and thinking “thats just looks confusing” Simple, legible code is the easiest to reason with. It’s not a cleverness competition. I think judicious use of <strong><em>subscripts</em></strong> can be a “just right” amount of improved code syntax.</p>\n<p>#iOSDev #Swift</p>\n<p> </p>\n",

				"title": "SwiftUI Map Marker Clustering",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>So as not to be one of those recipe web sites where all you want is the recipe, <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/squirrelpointstudios/swiftui-map-marker-clustering#\">the code for this sample project is here.</a></p>\n<p>I have a few app projects that make use of maps to convey location information. I prefer to work in SwiftUI when possible and this sometimes requires setting lower expectations of what you can achieve. While MapKit was recently improved for SwiftUI use, it still lacks features that are present in UIKit/AppKit. One of those missing features is support for “clustering” markers on the map. Clustering is when a group of map markers are joined into one where their display would otherwise overlap.</p>\n<p>In older, pre-SwiftUI, frameworks Apple provides robust support for clustering markers with just a few lines of code. Alas with SwiftUI, we don’t have that luxury and with the yearly release cycles we are unlikely to have this ability show up any time soon.</p>\n<p>I wanted to see if it was possible to do this myself so I did some research into how clustering is typically done. I came across many articles describing various methods and algorithms used to implement clustering and calculating the distance between map coordinates on the screen. You need both of these pieces to implement any solution. It’s not enough to say this two locations are 100 meters apart so their markers should be clustered. 100 meters means different things at different map scales. You would also like this clustering to happen any time the map is redrawn so it needs to be fast.</p>\n<p>There seems to be consensus around using the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBSCAN\">DBSCAN algorithm</a> to create clusters of locations on a map. I try to avoid math in order to avoid headaches but the basic concepts of the article linked above make sense and are worth browsing.  An implementation of the DBSCAN algorithm will take a group of items with coordinates, a distance to check for separation and a function to be used to determine the actual distance between any of those items.</p>\n<p>There are a few DBSCAN implementations available for Swift and I picked one and added it to my projects. A version is included in the repo for this sample project. I don’t recall where I found this implementation but I am certain it was free to use/distribute. If you are or know the author let me know and I’ll give credit.</p>\n<p>Give the DBSCAN algorithm we only need our location items and that distance function to determine how far apart any markers would be rendered on the map view.  More research reveals that it’s nice to be able to use your GPU to quickly process a bulk of point data to determine these distances. As luck would have it Apple has created a Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) library that contains methods to do this distance calculation very quickly. If you want to read more about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_instruction,_multiple_data\">SIMD head on over to Wikipedia</a>. All that you need to know to make use of Apples code is to import <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate/simd\">simd</a> into your project and call it accordingly.</p>\n<p>Now we get to the actual recipe of how to make use of all this math.</p>\n<p>For this sample project we will render a few peaks in the Catskill mountains. We also provide a static function to give us a few peaks.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Peak.swift screenshot.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2024/simple-mappeak.swift-screenshot.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"656\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You can easily render those sample peaks on a map in SwiftUI by iterating over the samplePeaks array and creating a Marker for each one. Doing so would show the overlapping problem we hope to clear up by implementing clustering. Notice in the upper right and lower left of the map a few peaks overlap.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-10-24 at 11.20.45.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2024/simple-mapscreenshot-2024-10-24-at-11.20.45.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"909\" height=\"709\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>So we need to render something other than these individual peaks.  What we will render is a marker for an array of peaks. That array may contain only one peak when there is no overlap but in instances where peak markers would overlap the array will contain more than one peak rendered as a single marker. Here is a simple implementation of a PeakCluster item that can be used to create these arrays.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"PeakCluster.swift_struct.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2024/simple-mappeakcluster.swift-struct.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"914\" height=\"148\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Should make sense so far but how do we determine which peak markers would overlap. As I mentioned in the intro above, it’s not just a matter of how far apart the peaks are in real world distances. Real world distances are rendered differently depending on how far in or out we are zoomed in the map. We will need a way to convert real world distances to map unit distances. This is where a MapReader and its provided proxy will come to our rescue. Next we will need a way to calculate these clusters as the user zooms in and out of the map. Thankfully SwiftUI makes this easy. There is a modifier on Map called <em>.onMapCameraChange</em>. This modifier will be invoked any time the camera changes (i.e. the user pans or zooms the map.) All we need to do is call our clustering algorithm to update our clusters each time.</p>\n<p>The implementation of this will look like this:</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-10-24 at 11.29.42.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2024/simple-mapscreenshot-2024-10-24-at-11.29.42.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"914\" height=\"706\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Notice the formerly overlapping peaks are now joined into one cluster. Clustered markers are rendered with the number of peaks in the cluster and color is used in this example to highlight the clusters.</p>\n<p>Simple, right? That “doClustering” method is doing some heavy lifting so let’s see how that magic happens.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"doClustering.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2024/simple-mapdoclustering.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"904\" height=\"752\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p><em>doClustering</em> requires two things to do it’s job. The first is the mapProxy so we can convert the peak latitude/longitude to map view units and the second thing is the actual peak items.</p>\n<p>First we define the method to be used to determine the distance between our items. In our case the items are Peaks and they have coordinate information. Here we call into SIMD2 (for 2d point calculations, other implemetations exist for 3d, etc) This dist function will be provided to our DBSCAN function to do the clustering.</p>\n<p>We instantiate a dbscan object with our peaks to be clustered then call its method to output the clusters and outliers. Clusters are groups of overlapping peaks and outliers are peaks that are to be rendered individually. I won’t cover how the dbscan implementation works here. Feel free to browse the code.</p>\n<p>Then we iterate over both the clusters and the outliers creating PeakClusters for each item. In this example we just use the coordinate of the fist peak in a closter as the coordinate for the cluster. You may want to use a different method, perhaps the center of the region containing all the peaks in the cluster. For this example this simplification will work. Clusters are given a name denoting how may peaks are contained therein. The size is set to the number of peaks in the cluster. This allows us to quickly determine the marker to render back on our map.</p>\n<p>Outliers are processed similarly. The coordinate for the outlier cluster is correctly set to the peaks coordinate as is the name and the size of one.</p>\n<p>We then return our markers (PeakClusters) to the calling method. </p>\n<p>This is only a very simple example to show the clustering. For an actual map app you probably need to do a bunch more. Several of the structs defined here are just barebones implementations and you might flesh out your Peak or PeakCluster objects to provide more needed data.</p>\n<p>This implementation feels ok. It’s not perfect. It doesn’t animate the changes from cluster to unclustered markers, for example. I would love to have that but I’m not sure it’s achievable here.</p>\n<p>One caveat is that while this code works well for iOS 18 projects, my original implementation was for iOS 17. Under iOS 17 I noticed that onMapCameraChange was called more than I would expect and in some cases the rendering of the markers before the map completed drawing would cause an infinite loop of redrawing the map. I was able to work around that with some hacks to check if I really wanted to be redrawing the map at those times. It was not an ideal solution and with iOS 18 things seem improved to the point that outside the math/algorithms to do the clustering the View code is pretty concise.</p>\n",

				"title": "Filtering on Enum Values in SwiftData Queries",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>While working on my current app I ran across an issue with SwiftData and filtering. SwiftData has support for enums in your models but you can’t directly sort or filter on those enum values. Hopefully this year will bring some improvements but I will outline my hack to work around this issue with the current versions of Swift/SwiftData. This post is current as of Swift 5.10/Xcode 15.3. I found very limited information on how to deal with this in my quick internet searches so hopefully this is helpful to others. As always, I’m interested in any feedback or suggestion how to do this better.</p>\n<p>Let’s say you have a model for some orders you are taking to sell some shirts. That might look something like this:<img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"OrderModel.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2024/ordermodel.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"704\" height=\"528\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Notice that two of the fields in our model are enum types. SwiftData will store these values and you can refer to the data stored within them. What you can not do currently is use those values to sort or filter when creating your queries.</p>\n<p>Your app might contain something like this to display all your orders in a List view:</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"ContentView.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2024/contentview.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"986\" height=\"555\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>That would render as:</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"AllOrdersScreen.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2024/allordersscreen.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"273\" height=\"544\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>All pretty standard stuff.</p>\n<p>You may want to be able to filter the list to only show orders with certain values, for example all orders with a given color. So you add the following to your view as an initializer:</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Init.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2024/init.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"663\" height=\"373\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>This looks pretty good and should result in the orders array only having items that match the specified color when a color is provided. Unfortunately that won’t work and the view will now show nothing. Xcode will not present an error or warning. Everything will build but nothing will be displayed. Your order array will be empty.</p>\n<p>You can experiment with many ways to define the predicate but all to no avail. My research indicated that SwiftData is storing the enum as binary data and it can not be used in this manner (hopefully only for now and this improves soon?)</p>\n<p>In order to be able to use the values within your enum for sort/filter actions you will need another way. Here is what I have come up with.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Updated Model.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2024/updated-model.png\" alt=\"Updated Model.\" width=\"683\" height=\"384\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>The order model now stores a mirrored value of the enum for color. This value is generated when you specify the color on order creation. </p>\n<p>Using this mirror value you can now filter the orders on the value stored in the color enum as follows:</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Updated Init.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2024/updated-init.png\" alt=\"Updated Init.\" width=\"783\" height=\"261\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Here we are using the mirrored colorString value in our predicate and we’ve defined that value as a string so everything works as expected.</p>\n<p>Note that for my purposes I never need to update the color after initialization or I would need to update the mirrored value. It may appear that the mirrored value could be defined as a dynamic property and simply return the rawValue of our color enum but I was unable to get that to work and it crashed the simulator any way I attempted this.</p>\n<p>As always when I post one of these hacks I sincerely hope someone comes along and tells me “no dummy just do this..” If you have a better solution I’d love to know. I spent hours on this before I RTFM and found the problem and formulated this hack. It works. I wish it wasn’t necessary.</p>\n<p>If you want to play with the example app I used to generate this post you can<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/pmcconnell/SwiftDataEnumPredicates\"> grab the source code it here </a></p>\n",

				"title": "Creating Sample HealthKit Data",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>A current app project I am working on uses <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit\">HealthKit</a> workout data as its data source. This makes life easier in that I don’t have to create my own models and manage the data, the frameworks will do this for me and all I need to do is access the users data. This is all well and good until you need to work in the simulator or Xcode previews where no HealthKit data is present.</p>\n<p>I’ve come up with an admittedly imperfect solution. It works well enough that I thought I would share. I welcome any thoughts on improvements. This solution is for iOS 17+ projects. </p>\n<p>My app will display your workout data for segments of time so you can compare your last 7 days against the prior 7 days, or months, or years. I display some graphs and text output of this data. I don’t record any data in the app and rely on any data the user has recorded via HealthKit. A rough screenshot looks like this:</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-04-02 at 11.29.03.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2024/screenshot-2024-04-02-at-11.29.03.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"434\" height=\"887\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>In the past I would just cobble together some code to use <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkworkout\">HKWorkout.init(…)</a> but with iOS 17 that method is deprecated in favor of <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkworkoutbuilder\">HKWorkoutBuilder.</a> I found the documentation on how to actually use HKWorkoutBuilder a bit lacking so after some trial and error I came up with the following solution. Your mileage may vary but for my use case this is enough to allow me to get back to work.</p>\n<p>Before you can access the users Health data you need to request permissions for either read/write or both. The final app I am creating will not write any user data so in order to write sample data I need to request additional permission to share data. I created a helper on HKHealthStore to request this permission:</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-04-02 at 11.40.17.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2024/screenshot-2024-04-02-at-11.40.17.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"673\" height=\"348\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>For the purposes of writing sample data to the health store we only need share access so here I pass an empty array of read values. This may be different from your actual app usage where you do need to read data. This helper is only for permission to write data. If your app already asked the user for read/write access and that access covers all the sample data you wish to write you may not need to request further permissions at all. The simulator either in the simulator app or Xcode previews will need this permission granted before any data can be written. tl;dr: if you already have permission in the simulator to write data you don’t need to call this method. If you do need permission this can help.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind the values I’m asking to share are for my app needs. You may need to edit the list to request access to other data types.</p>\n<p>In my case I want to create workouts that occur at various intervals such as 7 day periods. For my sample data I created a struct to allow me to specify enough information to create workouts with specific start/end dates and pass along a few stats, in this case the workout distance and energy burned. In my app it’s important the data is relative to the current date so I create data offset from Date.now. Your needs will most certainly vary but I explain this here so that the code to add workouts will make sense.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-04-02 at 11.47.10.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2024/screenshot-2024-04-02-at-11.47.10.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"785\" height=\"271\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Next I have the actual code to add workouts to the health store. Notice the method takes a PreviewWorkout which we defined above.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-04-02 at 11.51.39.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2024/screenshot-2024-04-02-at-11.51.39.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"936\" height=\"621\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>The add(…) method uses the new HKWorkoutBuilder to create a workout and add samples. Here we create a workout with the type defined in our PreviewWorkout, add two different HKQuantitySamples and then finish the sample collection and workout in that order. Assuming you have the correct permissions, the workout will be written to the devices health store.</p>\n<p>To use this sample data in your Xcode previews you’ll need to call these methods prior to displaying the preview. Since add(…) is async you need to wrap the call in a Task{} but you may quickly notice that your samples are growing each time you refresh the preview. We need a way to clear the samples so we don’t keep adding new versions of the same data.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-04-02 at 11.46.14.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2024/screenshot-2024-04-02-at-11.46.14.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"743\" height=\"381\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p><em>self.fetchWorkouts()</em> calls another method in a HKHealthStore extension that I created to grab all workouts matching a type and between two dates. There are plenty of examples of fetching workout data available so I’ll not share that code here. Suffice to say, it will return an array of workouts matching the criteria.</p>\n<p>Here we just grab all the workouts for the past 5 years (adjust if needed for your samples) and remove all the existing workouts. Calling this prior to adding new samples ensures we only have one set of our sample data. </p>\n<p>Putting it all together in one method can look something like this:</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-04-02 at 12.00.53.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2024/screenshot-2024-04-02-at-12.00.53.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"404\" height=\"262\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Here we get our preview data from another extension, again your data and methods may vary. We then grab the default store, remove existing data and write our samples. We return the store if it’s helpful, I’m not currently using the returned value. </p>\n<p>So to make all this work within previews you can do something along these lines:</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-04-02 at 11.55.21.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2024/screenshot-2024-04-02-at-11.55.21.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"359\" height=\"123\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>There are two issues with this. First this will needlessly create the samples each time the preview is refreshed. This is unnecessary unless you’ve updated the sample data and need to refresh it. The other problem is there is a race and the data will not always show on first drawing of the preview. Interacting with the preview should show the sample data as that will redraw the UI. I have not figured out how to get this first rendering of the preview to wait for the sample data (without needlessly mucking up my actual code) but as long as the data is present it will be displayed on any subsequent preview renders. </p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Screenshot 2024-04-02 at 12.06.36.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2024/screenshot-2024-04-02-at-12.06.36.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"399\" height=\"182\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>If you only need it for previews/simulator debugging you can place this extension and any sample data in the Preview Content folder within Xcode and it will only be compiled into the debug builds.</p>\n<p>I’ve settled on this solution for my usage. Here I have a boolean value I can manually set to update the preview data. I generally leave it set to false unless I need to update the sample data. The key is once the sample data is in the simulators health store it remains there unless you wipe the simulator.</p>\n<p>If you need sample data in the full simulator you can adapt these same methods. I’ve created an .onAppear{} block that requests share access and writes the data. I can comment this block out after the data is written and uncomment for updates. It works the same as described here for previews. For my usage, I am mostly using the previews for UI adjustments and when I need real hard data I run on my personal iPhone</p>\n<p>I welcome any input on how this may be improved. I already understand this is a bit hacky and rigid but sometimes that’s all that’s needed to get back to work on the actual project. Obviously you will need to adjust everything I outline here for match your needs. I thought it was helpful to at least document one approach to working with HKWorkoutBuilder.</p>\n<p>I’ve uploaded both the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/-/snippets/3694748\">HKHealthStore extension and my sample data structs to Gitlab as a snippet</a> if you wish to make use of the code. The code is provided as is and you are free to use/adapt it for your use.</p>\n",

The problems are purely Apple’s making and are almost all caused by simple greed. Isn’t it always?</p>\n<p>It is convenient for them that things like privacy provide cover for some behaviors. That doesn’t make things like privacy unimportant and certainly not worth compromising too much in these areas.</p>\n<p>Another interesting thing is seeing all the Apple pundits choosing very clear sides on this. I think any rational thinking Apple observer can point out dozens of places where Apple could do better by consumers or developers but stubbornly sticks to their ways. Blindly defending Apple is a bad look. They are not without many faults here. At the same time, bashing Apple blindly with “I told you so…” is equally poor form.</p>\n<p>I believe this is yet another one of those situations where nuance is needed. Yes, Apple often behaves badly. At the same time It’s possible that these things don’t rise to the level of monopoly abuse.  If we, as a supposed democracy, want to curtail some of these behaviors we need better laws. I don’t think the current laws address this adequately. Nor do I believe the people in power are knowledgable enough to deal with these sorts of technical things in the ways that are required.</p>\n<p>Along with “AI”** I fear this sort of “distraction” will just slow improvements to the development tools we use every day. It already takes Apple years to improve on some frameworks. I would  prefer they improve MapKit for SwiftUI and 100 other things rather than waste time dealing with this nonsense.</p>\n<p>** I realize some level of this so called “AI” is needed. I don’t want it to absorb all the oxygen in the room. Much like I know they spent years on the Vision Pro but right now I don’t care. I have work to do on the other platforms likely to be shortchanged by focus in these other areas for the foreseeable future.</p>\n",

The site is based on an earlier concept and out of date right now however there is useful information there and in the <a href=\"https://peakist.app/faq.html\">FAQ</a>.</p>\n<p>I believe the world needs more apps that don’t treat users as a data farm so I track nothing and share nothing.

				"content_text": "<p>I think everyone who does indie development harbors the dream of shipping an app or two that can earn them a living. The reality is that’s probably not going to happen and even if it does it’s going to take a lucky break and be a long term project. <br /><br />I tend to be the type to add too many features (<em>featuritis</em>) and be too picky when planning my own apps. This comes from wanting to build a great product as well as making it compelling for users to spend their cash.</p>\n<p>There is also the constant worry that I will embarrass myself with a less than amazing app. Classic imposter syndrome. I’ve shipped dozens of successful apps and I still feel like I have no idea what I’m doing or how I accomplished that. For me, this all leads to paralysis and difficulty shipping. <br /><br />As an example, several of my apps make heavy use of maps and <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkit\">Apple's MapKit</a> has been a moving target since the advent of <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/\">SwiftUI</a>. The app(s) in question have been in development for a while and I’ve gone back and forth between interfacing with MapKit via <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/uiviewrepresentable\">UIViewRepresentable,</a> using <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkit/mapkit_for_swiftui\">MapKit for SwiftUI</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mapbox.com/\">MapBox</a> for some time. <br /><br />I’ve recently learned that Mapbox now has “experimental” support for native SwiftUI frameworks so I experimented with that as well. It works fine.</p>\n<p>The point is I’ve redone the map support in my apps at least five times and this app is yet to ship.<br /><br />I have been working on these apps a long time, rearchitecting/redesigning them over the past 18 months. I’ve been looking to create an awesome map experience when the map in my app is a secondary feature.<br /><br />Over the past few days I decided to step back and rethink my assumptions around app features considering the possibility I am overthinking things and maybe, just maybe, I can get by with a simpler approach. I really want to use the latest SwiftUI based stuff as much as possible. Working with the new SwiftUI frameworks is so much simpler than most of the older frameworks. That’s not saying SwiftUI is perfect. Far from it.</p>\n<p>I think the SwiftUI route may lead to shipping something quicker. The key will be in not fighting the frameworks. Yes, SwiftUI is incomplete in areas and may not lend itself to all the customization we enjoyed in the UIKit/AppKit days. It’s best to stop fighting SwiftUI and make use of what’s there.</p>\n<p><strong><em>A clean, working app that has shipped should be better than a fancy custom app that never sees the light of day.</em></strong></p>\n<p>Using the most recent SwiftUI frameworks also limits an app to the latest iOS release. Just accept it and get on with the work. It’s just not worth fighting to provide last gen support for an app that doesn’t yet exist. If a market develops and cries for older OS support that’s a good problem to have and something to be dealt with in the future.</p>\n<p>Single device support is good enough for a version 1.0. It’s not necessary to work with <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreData/index.html\">CoreData</a> or <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftdata\">SwiftData</a> to sync data across devices. When creating a new app just ship on one platform and worry about adding sync support later. It’s likely that in creating a multi-device app you will need to do extra work to make a real iOS/iPad/Mac app anyway. The goal should be to ship first and iterate. Don’t worry about multi-platform and syncing support in the first version.</p>\n<p>When the average app price is probably <em>nothing</em>, is it worth building all these features? I got into software development because it was fun. It’s always worth remembering that and reassessing what brings you joy and focusing on that.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://peakist.app/\">My current app project</a> using maps is a project that scratches a personal itch. It started out as a fun project to build something I want to use. Over time it’s become a bit of a chore. It’s time to bring the fun back and let the rest sort itself out.</p>\n<p>Thanks for coming to my inner monolog indie app dev pep talk.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>If you’re only interested in the code to show a user location on the map a plain text code listing is at the end of this post...</em></p>\n<p>I’ve been rethinking my approach to maps in some of my apps lately and I’m taking another pass at trying to use <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkit/mapkit_for_swiftui\">SwiftUI and the new MapKit</a> in lieu of wrapping the UIKit MapKit views in <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/uiviewrepresentable\">UIViewRepresentable</a>. I’ve implemented a <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkit/mkmapview\">MKMapView</a> wrapper a few times now and I find it inelegant amongst all the concise SwiftUI code.</p>\n<p>I understand that if I need the features that aren’t currently available via SwiftUI I need to use the wrapper but that’s a big part of my rethink. Do I really need all the features I’ve been considering? I have a tendency to over scope projects and make shipping harder than needed.</p>\n<p>I sat down to watch the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/wwdc23/10043\">Meet MapKit for SwiftUI</a> video again. I’ve already watched this video a handful of times. It covers a great deal of ground and explains the new features pretty well.</p>\n<p>I want the ability to show the users location on the map. According to the video its a single line of code:</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"BodyView.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/bodyview.png\" alt=\"BodyView\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Not so fast. In the video this displays the users location and enables other features using this location.</p>\n<p>If you’ve used the old MapKit you may recall needing to get the users permission before being given access to their location. In order to do that you had to rely on the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation\">CoreLocation</a> framework. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>The WWDC video makes no mention of any of this but it’s still required</strong></span>.</p>\n<p>Just like in the UIKit based MapKit you need to edit your <em>Info.plist</em> to provide a string explaining why you need to know the users location. You also need to rely on CoreLocation's LocationManager class in order to prompt the user to allow access to their location and keep track if permission has been granted.</p>\n<p>In your apps <em>Info.plist</em> add an entry for one of the privacy requests based on your need. For example, if you only need the users location while they are in the app add “<em>Privacy - Location When in Use Usage Description</em>” with a string that will be shown to the user when asking permission. Anything will work here but keep in mind when shipping your app that Apple might review what you ask for here. I’ve had no problems being blunt. Something like “Displaying Users Location on the Map” is fine.</p>\n<p>Note there are several privacy fields referencing location use. Make sure you select the correct one and your code matches the type of usage you need. Selecting the wrong permission in the Info.plist can cause user location to not work and fail silently with no indication of the error.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"InfoPlist Screenshot.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/e42cf7b7f6.png\" alt=\"InfoPlist Screenshot\" width=\"642\" height=\"41\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Once you have edited the plist you need to add an instance of CLLocationManager to your view and be sure you’ve asked for permission.  This is the minimum I’ve found to display the users location:</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"MinimumContentBody.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/minimumcontentbody.png\" alt=\"MinimumContentBody\" width=\"1366\" height=\"768\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Note that this code is asking only for permission to see the users location while they are using the app. If you require background usage, adjust both <em>Info.plist</em> and this code to request what you need. </p>\n<p>By default a preview view will show the map zoomed out to show all of North America with the user located at Apple Park in Cupertino, CA.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Map Preview Screenshot.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/map-preview-screenshot.png\" alt=\"Map Preview Screenshot\" width=\"708\" height=\"1462\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>One other new feature of MapKit for SwiftUI is the ability to add additional map controls to the view such as the map scale, compass or a button to zoom to the user location. The screenshot above shows the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkit/mapuserlocationbutton\">MapUserLocationButton</a> in its default location. You may not need this in your apps but I find this button very handy, even if only during debugging, to quickly check that things are working so update the code to add a <em>mapControls</em> modifier so it looks like this:</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"MapWithUserButton.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/mapwithuserbutton.png\" alt=\"MapWithUserButton\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>In my initial experiments with getting user location displayed it seemed all that was needed was to ask if the user has given permission and if not ask. I tried various ways of asking for permission and settled on what is shown here. If you play around with this you may wonder why the @State is required to store the <em>CLLocationManager</em> instance at all. It is needed so that the map can update the view when the users location changes. If you omit the @State for the CLLocationManager and try something like this:</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"IncorrectLocationManagerRequest.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/incorrectlocationmanagerrequest.png\" alt=\"IncorrectLocationManagerRequest\" width=\"1604\" height=\"535\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>you will see the users position on the map with the familiar blue dot BUT it will not update if and when the user moves. The new SwiftUI implementation of MapKit gives you easy user location tracking but only if you provide a @State to hold the instance of the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/cllocationmanager\">CLLocationManager</a>.</p>\n<p>Thus far I have been unable to get the preview views to show any other locations than the default at Apple Park in Cupertino, CA. The simulator <em>will</em> show the various provided user location options or even a custom location you specify by latitude and longitude. </p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Simulating Other User Locations</strong></span></p>\n<p>If you want to see the user location update in the simulator based on Apple provided presets, run the app code provided here on a simulator device. Once the app is running and you have granted permission to show your location, press the MapUserLocationButton in the upper right to zoom in. Next select Features -&gt; Location -&gt; Freeway Drive from the simulator menu:</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Simulator Location Screnshot.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/simulator-location-screnshot.png\" alt=\"Simulator Location Screnshot\" width=\"474\" height=\"439\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>If you are zoomed in close enough you will see the location update as if you were driving on the California freeway. The other location options simulate various routes and locations. You can also enter a custom location to show the user at a specific location. For example this will simulate the user being located in Times Square New York City.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Time Square Coordinates.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/time-square-coordinates.png\" alt=\"Time Square Coordinates\" width=\"502\" height=\"328\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>If you want to simulate locations while debugging on an actual device. Debug the app from Xcode and select Debug -&gt; Simulate Location -&gt;  then select a location</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Xcode Locations Screenshot.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/xcode-locations-screenshot.png\" alt=\"Xcode Locations Screenshot\" width=\"568\" height=\"810\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>If you are zoomed in enough when selecting a location you will see the map view animate to the new location. Again, I have been unable to get locations other than the default to work in the Preview View. If you have a trick to accomplish that let me know.</p>\n<p>All of the code and screenshots shown here were generated on Xcode 15.0.1, simulators and preview running iOS 17.0.1  and my actual iPhone running iOS 17.1.  </p>\n<p><em>An earlier version of this post stated that MapKit support was compatible back to iOS 14. That is not correct. While the base Map view is supported that far back the newer MapContentBuilder features that enable Markers, Annotation, etc. require iOS 17.</em></p>\n<p>Here is a text code listing for a ContentView.swift that shows all the things discussed here.</p>\n<pre>//<br />//  ContentView.swift<br />//  Location<br />//<br />//  Created by Patrick McConnell on 10/27/23.<br />//<br /><br />import SwiftUI<br />import MapKit<br />import CoreLocation<br /><br />struct ContentView: View {<br />    @State private var lm = CLLocationManager()<br /><br />    var body: some View {<br />        Map() {<br />            UserAnnotation()<br />        }<br />        .mapControls {<br />            MapUserLocationButton()<br />        }<br />        .onAppear {<br />            if lm.authorizationStatus == .notDetermined {<br />                lm.requestWhenInUseAuthorization()<br />            }<br />        }<br />    }<br />}<br /><br /><br />#Preview {<br />    ContentView()<br />}<br /><br /><br /></pre>\n",

Even the “open\" and “free\" paths can lead to dead ends in some SAAS product.</p>\n<p>I’ve been working on some map based products/apps for a long while. While the map frameworks available on the various platforms such as iOS and Android are good, I do need to extend what they are capable of. Things like offline viewing of a map or custom appearances (such as topography) are just not available out of the box in these frameworks.</p>\n<p>I am well aware of the steps required to render custom map tiles as I’ve done it in the past. Nowadays it seems like a wall has been thrown up around the tools and info needed to accomplish these sorts of tasks. I can find all sorts of documentation on how to generate the custom images necessary for offline map viewing or styling of my maps but inevitably at some point in my reading the path will lead to some paid tool/service.</p>\n<p>These services are free to market themselves and charge for what they are offering. I’m not suggesting there is anything wrong with that. I’m sure it helps many people accomplish things quickly and “easily” however I prefer not to rely on others. I’ve seen enough in the past to want to control as much of my code as possible. I just prefer to do things myself whenever possible.</p>\n<p>In the case of mapping tools I believe at some point in the past many these tools were freely available and widely known.  Somewhere along the line, the tools were put behind a pay wall and the ladder pulled up so that thick skulled fools such as myself have to really dig to find out how to do this themselves.</p>\n<p>I think on a more broad level this is similar to many things that used to be freely available but have now converted to a subscription.

It should be as it costs a lot of money.</p>\n<p>The real story is what e-bikes do for you. </p>\n<p>Prior to getting my new Cannondale I had only ridden one other e-bike before. It was a very brief ride down a short driveway into the road and back after which I dismounted and returned the bike to its owner. That bike, of no specific brand, was a folding bike with 16” wheels and a throttle. It was fast. It was jerky. It felt dangerous. I’m not slagging on that sort of bike. I’m sure they have their uses and like any tool, when used responsibly you can get good results with it.</p>\n<p>I am also reasonably certain that all the media panic recently about e-bikes relates to these sorts of bikes and people not being as responsible on them as they might otherwise be. Mostly I think that hype is just nonsense in general. Yes, bike batteries can catch fire. Know what else catches fire? Cars, Phones, Computers and other things with lithium ion batteries.  If you buy a product that seems a bit cheaper than some of the other options in that market you might expect some corners were cut but beyond that shit happens. Do some users of e-bikes ride recklessly? Most certainly. Do pickup trucks the size of city blocks sometimes come too close to me on the road? All too often. Sure let’s get out the pitchforks for e-bikes just as they might start to cut into our over dependence on cars and the minor impact those cars are having on out planet. I’m certain bikes are the appropriate target right now.</p>\n<p>Anyway...</p>\n<p>As I said above this is a great bike and it costs a bunch of money. Money I never would have spent had I not had a substantial discount with Cannondale due to a warranty claim from an old bike. I did not pay retail for this bike. Prior to getting this new ride I thought I might get an e-bike one day as I’m getting older and I suffer from knee pain on the bike from time to time. However while looking at the Cannondale catalog it soon became clear that now was as good a time as any to get into e-biking.</p>\n<p>As a lifelong cyclist I fought mental battles with myself over how I’m not that old and don’t need a bike to “cheat\" on my rides. For the record, I’ve never accused anyone I see out riding an e-bike of cheating. In fact I often say to my wife that it’s better than them driving or just sitting on the couch. When it was time for me to consider an e-bike I was much harder on myself than necessary. I already have 3 other bikes that all see use for different types of riding. Besides raging against aging my fear was I may not ride those other bikes as much as before.  My knee pains won out and I ordered the Tesoro.</p>\n<p>You can get the bike specifications on the Cannondale site and I’m sure you can find other much more technical reviews elsewhere. The bike has a Bosch drivetrain and a mid drive motor. For those unaware there are two general types of drives, mid drive and hub drive. Mid drive features a motor directly attached to the cranks while a hub drive is in the wheel. I only have limited experience here but all signs point to the mid drive being smoother and more natural feeling. I’m certain that you can spend enough to get an excellent hub drive e-bike.</p>\n<p>This bike has a mid drive and it is smooth once you get used to it. I’m not even sure “smooth” is the right word. There is a unnatural sensation readily apparent to long time cyclists on that first e-bike ride. It’s a sensation that arises from putting in the effort that you would expect to result in your speedometer reading 12 MPH but seeing 16MPH. It’s the difference in mashing the pedals to get up a hill at 5 MPH and continuing to spin the pedals lightly and scaling the hill at 12 MPH. That uncanny sensation passes after the first few miles and quickly gets you thinking where can I go with this? How far will it take me? Can I finally see what’s down that road I always avoid due to the steep grade. Thus far my answers have all be in the positive.</p>\n<p>After a few weeks, I have a little over 200 miles on the bike. I typically rode 20 mile rides on a steel touring bike prior to getting the Tesoro. I am the sort of rider out there in a button down shirt and my regular hiking/walking shorts. I don’t don the lycra. I’m not racing. I’m riding out of my driveway and seeing what’s out there. I go slow. I derive joy from following some new road, not how fast I did my route. Nothing wrong with lycra or going fast but that’s not me. This bike opens up new possibilities for me. I am getting older and I do resist more strenuous rides from time to time.</p>\n<p>I am always curious what’s up that hill (and there are lots of rural hilly roads near me) From the first ride on this new bike I have just said “sure” every time I asked myself “should I see what’s up that road?” The bike will help me and I won’t suffer uphill or into the wind. My rides are now closer to 30 miles on average. I’m still pedaling, sweating and burning calories. Just going a little faster and a little farther with about the same effort as before.</p>\n<p>E-biking for me has been about giving me more me. I could always get up the hills or do 40 miles into the wind. I have done those things many times. Now I can do those same things easier. The bike has 4 settings for assist, eco, touring, sport and turbo. None of them allow you to stop pedaling. They just increase how much help you get from the motor (and how quickly the battery will drain and thus your range) As I mentioned I am a slow and steady, see what’s out there rider so I mostly stick to eco mode. I still do most of the work. I go a bit faster for the same effort. I don’t care about the speed increase at all. Sure it’s fun to pop it into turbo mode and quickly speed up to over 20 MPH but to me that is not why I bike so it’s a minor feature (and it eats battery)</p>\n<p>I’ve found the advertised range to be accurate. The bike is rated to go 80 miles on a charge. While I have not yet done a single ride of that length I have done 40+ mile rides and still had more than half the battery. On most of my rides I mainly use the eco setting for minimal assist and maximum range but I am frequently popping into the higher levels of assist if only to climb a hill or overcome some other obstacle. I suspect I could get 90+ miles with my usage.</p>\n<p>The quality of the bike is good. The key components are excellent such as the Bosch drivetrain and the frame. The gears and brakes seem adequate. They work fine but I suspect if you were on a regular bike you might prefer a better derailleur for example. The control/computer screen is adequate. I only say this as my wife recently got a Specialized Como that has a better computer than the Cannondale. The Cannondale does not support any apps nor is it a color screen. It does do what it needs to do in a clear way and that’s good enough. My wife’s bike computer doesn’t have any features I miss with the possible exception of interfacing with apps. Not important.</p>\n<p>A big plus for me is how this bike is accessorized. It features front and rear lights, a rack, bell and fenders. If you’re the type of rider who rides a fender bike you know why this is important to you. You can ride in most any conditions and not come home covered in mud or wet. The fenders are large to cover the giant tires. They are solid but tend to make a bunch of noise in combination with the tires picking up gravel, etc and sending it in a trip around the fender. All fenders do this but these seem louder or more prone to it. Not a complaint but rather an observation.</p>\n<p>Part of my justification for getting this e-bike was to take even more load off my Subaru. I already use my other bikes to run local errands but I hope to use this bike to go farther afield where I might have used the car in the past. Having said that in the first few weeks I’ve own the Cannondale I’ve reverted back to my other bikes to run all bike ranged errands. My grocery store is less than a mile away and I could walk. I don’t need a $3k+ bike to get there. I do live very close to an excellent bike trail that runs between two cities we frequent for errands and dining. I envision using the e-bikes to do the 25 mile round trip while not being concerned about post meal bloat slowing us down.</p>\n<p>If you’re thinking I want to do no work and “ride a bike” this is not that bike. There are bikes with throttles that allow you to just sit, press the throttle and get where you’re going.</p>\n<p>This is a heavy bike. You could ride it with no assist if necessary but it’s not ideal. In eco mode it feels like the assist gets you over the heft of the bike and a bit more. The other assist levels make the bike feel lighter and faster and at the highest level you are in electric motorcycle territory. In turbo mode a minimal amount of input will get you up the gnarliest hill and quickly have you speeding along at 25+ MPH. Your range will also drop down quite a lot. If you only need to go a few miles it might be fun to zip around in the higher assist levels. I prefer to save the battery to cover more ground.</p>\n<p>So yeah, this is not really a review of the Cannondale Tesoro Neo X3. It’s a review of what an e-bike can do for your life. They allow you to do more. If you previously didn’t ride at all you might find an e-bike gets you out riding. If you typically ride 10 mile routes you might up that to 20 on the e-bike. If you have knee pain, like me, you might be able to take some of the load off and continue to enjoy your rides. If you often take a 10+ mile ride somewhere and think it might be nice to have some food and drinks but decide against it considering the ride home you might get enough assistance from the bike to make that a less of a burden. If you’ve been riding around your neighborhood for years and have yet to see what’s up that road with the 10% grade you might just cruise up there and see.</p>\n<p>The best feature of any e-bike is it allows you to regain some of that joy you felt as a kid with your first bike. That sense of freedom that all bikes bring is a little easier to achieve on an e-bike. Sure it can be a cargo hauling, commuting to work tool but most importantly it’s just plain fun.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>From the department of little things that (still) make for quality apps…</p>\n<p>I'm currently working on a Go API for a new product we’re working on at <a href=\"https://squirrelpointstudios.com\">Squirrel Point Studios</a>. My current editor of choice is <a href=\"https://nova.app/\">Nova</a> by <a href=\"https://panic.com/\">Panic.</a> I have the app configured to allow me to run the app and tests in several ways right in the editor. I’m a fan of turning my editors into an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment\">IDE</a> when possible.</p>\n<p>I like accomplishing as many parts of the development process in one app. Nova delivers on this in much the same way as something like <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">Visual Studio Code</a>. Sure there is a smaller audience and thus a smaller extension library but this doesn’t mean you can’t do the same things. There may only be 2-3 Go extensions vs 100 that might exist in the other editor but you can get what you want done.</p>\n<p>I’ve used VS Code for years and it’s probably the best example of an <a href=\"https://www.electronjs.org/\">Electron app</a> there is but it’s not a native app and never will be. I’ve built Electron apps when it served the purpose at hand. It has its benefits but native is almost always better unless you’re looking to cut some corner (expense.) More correctly, native apps have more upside than other solutions. Not all native apps live up to what is possible but some do and it’s worth seeking them out.</p>\n<p>One of the side effects of using Nova as an IDE (and why I started this whole brain dump…) is you can end up with several tabs of output from various actions. I tend to keep these tabs in a pane at the bottom of the editor view, as shown here. </p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Screenshot 2023-08-29 at 14.58.03.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/screenshot-2023-08-29-at-14.58.03.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023 08 29 at 14 58 03\" width=\"599\" height=\"558\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Today I closed all my source code files to start on a new feature leaving only the report tabs open. My OCD causes me to need these panels to appear in the bottom of the editor. In one of those “it just works\" moments that have become more infrequent over time, I right clicked on a report tab that I had moved to the lower pane and in the menu that appeared there is an option for “Move All Report Tabs To This Pane.” This was unexpected and very welcome. Sure I could have just dragged the handful of tabs to the lower pane but someone at Panic thought this might be helpful and took the time to add this feature. I salute that person and all the folks at shops like Panic that still care enough to add these little touches that are probably missed by 90% of users.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Screenshot 2023-08-29 at 14.59.36.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/screenshot-2023-08-29-at-14.59.36.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023 08 29 at 14 59 36\" width=\"366\" height=\"260\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>I remember when I first started using a Mac full time around the time of OS X 10.1. Those early days were full of little moments where you would just try things to see if they worked and very often they did. As MacOS has matured and more so as web apps have displaced native applications we see less and less of these little bits of forethought that reveal themselves as “magic.”</p>\n<p>I think these little touches should be part of the spec for <a href=\"https://collindonnell.com\">Mac-assed Apps, a term coined by Collin Donnell </a> that I learned about via this post from <a href=\"https://inessential.com/2020/03/19/proxyman\">Brent Simmons</a>. This sort of thing is why I continue to fight the battle against web apps and universal frameworks. Sure, there are good examples but a conservative estimate might be 1:1,000 good vs adequate applications. Those of us who understand this are still out here using old school apps like <a href=\"https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/\">BBEdit</a> and new fangled examples like <a href=\"https://nova.app/\">Nova</a>. We resist the temptation of the new shiny thing everyone else is using because these Mac-assed apps do the job and often do it better if you just give them a chance.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>Everyone else is doing it so here is my post on WWDC.</p>\n<p>As a long time Apple developer I have always followed the events of WWDC. Some years I am working in other areas and I don’t follow as closely as others. This year I am in the middle of a few projects for iPhone/iPad/Mac so I was watching intently for things I could use. </p>\n<p>I’ve done this long enough that I know that anything announced can’t be used for at least a few month until the new frameworks and platform updates are released. When doing consulting work I am usually required to support a few older OS versions so even after the frameworks are released they are often not available to use. On my own personal projects I will jump in and require the latest OS if it’s compelling enough. Apple device users tend to update quickly and my philosophy is that people who don’t update are probably not a large group of app buyers anyway.</p>\n<p>Right now I am working on several mapping app projects (<a href=\"https://peakist.app\">Peakist</a> being one.) I prefer to work in SwiftUI when possible as it’s just easier when it does what you need. I am comfortable falling back to using UIKit when needed but it is cumbersome so I was hoping for improvements to MapKit with SwiftUI. I dared not actively wish for this as Apple moves very slowly and rarely gives you what you want in a timely fashion. I was very happily surprised when the keynote mentioned MapKit related items like offline maps and topographic map styles. However, when I went to bed that night thinking of how I would refactor my apps to use these new things it dawned on me that perhaps Apple didn’t expose these features to developers. The next morning I dug into the docs and videos and my fears were correct. While Apple has given Map app itself the ability to download maps for offline use there is no public framework for developers to do so. More frustrating, personally, the topo map style is not available outside Apple’s own use for the Map app on the watch.</p>\n<p>Still the improvements to MapKit with SwiftUI for non-topo map projects are compelling. In some quick experiments I was able to replace my UIKit map bridge containing 100s of lines of code with a handful of lines of SwiftUI code. That’s a huge win and I will use this for future projects.</p>\n<p>All the other improvements to the platforms look great as well. I haven’t dug into what is and isn’t accessible for developers but I’ll get there when I need some new features.</p>\n<p>The headset looks like impressive technology but I think Gruber eloquently summed up what I was thinking when he talked about whether it makes a “<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2023/06/first_impressions_of_vision_pro_and_visionos\">compelling product</a>” It looks like an amazing toy at a minimum and I would like to try it but I don’t see a reason to buy it. <strong><em>Yet</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>If it was under $1k I might feel differently but the current price is too high for something that I feel currently has limited use. I’m not saying it’s too expensive for what it is. Sure there is an Apple premium I suppose but it’s just more costly than I can justify to play with. This is all likely to change once use cases emerge and more software is available. I suspect this will be similar to the watch where apple tossed out all sorts of ideas at launch and it eventually settled into a fitness/notification device. </p>\n<p>I’ve yet to use a VR headset that doesn’t quickly make me nauseous so I most defiantly would not purchase one without trying it. I sounds like some of the things they have done here will help with that but time will tell.</p>\n<p>I think it’s clear from many of the improvements and new frameworks that Apple is increasing their dogfood-ing of SwiftUI. Things many of us have asked for are being added and they look like great implementations. I’m sure holes remain, and I’ve found a few myself, but things are improving. </p>\n<p>The big win for me this week has been <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@patrickmcconnell\">Mastodon</a> and finding more interesting people to interact with. I’ve had great conversations with people working in the same areas as me and look forward to continuing discussions in the future.</p>\n<p>Sure there are the usual negative borderline trolls abusing the #wwdc hashtag but for the most part it’s been a very positive experience. I do understand some of the concerns about the walled garden, patent locked software, climate change and how many animals were harmed in the production of this toy for the rich and powerful. I get it but this is still impressive technology and let us just geek out for a bit. For some of the concern trolls I offer the words of the dude:</p>\n<p><img title=\"Fo-FtF-X0AAo1SS.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/a8f60f1e03.jpg\" alt=\"Fo FtF X0AAo1SS\" width=\"259\" height=\"258\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>So as the WWDC week winds down, I’m watching the videos and reading the docs longing for the time when I can make use of the new tools. Right now I have to ship a few things so I need to suppress my immediate disappointments with missing features and the lack of ability to use what is provided in beta frameworks. Still it’s inspiring to see the new things coming and I continue on with current projects with a bit more enthusiasm.</p>\n",

				"title": "Creating a SwiftUI Launch Screen",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p><strong>Some Background</strong></p>\n<p>iOS and iPadOS apps both support a launch screen that will be shown first when the app launches. The purpose of the launch screen is to indicate the app has launched but it may still be doing some background tasks or unwrapping the UI before it’s ready for the user. It’s traditional to show a splash screen or an image of your actual UI for the launch screen. This makes the app feel responsive and the device feel fast. This has always been a bit of an Apple sponsored hack to make things feel smooth and quick for users. It works.</p>\n<p>The old way of creating a launch screen is by defining a view in a storyboard and pointing Xcode to that view. That view might be just a UIImage or it could be any view you like. This worked fine in the days of UIKit where you may have already created the UI views in a storyboard so you could easily replicate your UI view as a launch screen in order to make it appear the app was loading quickly. </p>\n<p>In the days of SwiftUI where many things remain in flux, there are new ways to create launch screens. You can still use the older method but it’s more difficult to create a view that matches the view you dynamically generate in your SwiftUI code. </p>\n<p>In my current app my initial view is displaying a circular image close to the center of the screen and that image is magically sized in my SwiftUI code to best fit the screen. There are several other text elements displayed and I don’t do much more to place them then drop them all in a VStack and using some spacers. Replicating that magic in a UIView from a storyboard is difficult and some things may in fact not be possible. In order to come up with something that didn’t create a jarring transition from launch to live UI I needed a solution.</p>\n<p>The newer method of creating launch screens is to specify some values in your info.plist file and let the compiler build a launch screen for you. Unfortunately you can only pick a background color and image to be shown along with options to display navigation items such as a navigation bar or a tab bar. This method may work if you just want a splash screen shown before the real UI but for other usage it’s not great.</p>\n<p>My app starts by displaying a full view loading screen so using a splash screen that transitions to what amounts to another splash screen before the actual UI seemed like a bad idea.</p>\n<p>I started by trying to mimic the loading view in UIKit to appear that the loading view was displayed immediately upon launch but I quickly tired of setting constraints and trying for pixel perfection between UIKit and SwiftUI. I spent some time thinking it over and thought what if I didn’t use a launch screen at all? Up until this point in the development cycle this was how the app was working and it wasn’t awful but it also lacked a bit of the polish you like to see in a finished product.</p>\n<p>When my app launches the first thing it needs to do is query an API for data updates. I initially display a loading view to indicate to the user that something is happening before we can present any data. In my current app this loading screen is a full screen view and that works well with this solution I’m presenting here.</p>\n<p>I decided to make it appear as if the loading view <em>was</em> the launch screen and that loading view would fade in as the app launched. The launch screen is just a blank view with the background color set to match the color of my apps initial screen. Then my loading view is displayed with a fade in animation that presents a nice transition from the blank launch canvas to the actual UI. It’s fast enough in practice that it’s not noticeable what’s happening. The user just sees the UI fade in and the app is ready.</p>\n<p><strong>Sample App</strong></p>\n<p>I put together a <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/patrickmcconnell/swiftui-launch-screen\">sample app</a> that shows this in more detail and here is some explanation of the steps taken.</p>\n<p>In the sample app, which is similar to my current project, there is a view model that fetches some data and reports its state. The state of the view model can be one of <em>loading</em>, <em>ready</em> or <em>error</em> depending on the result of the data fetch.</p>\n<p>There is a main view that switches its display based on the state of the view model. So on initial launch, while the view model state is <em>loading</em>\" a LoadingView is shown, as shown below:</p>\n<p><img title=\"content_view.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/879ff6a6c4.png\" alt=\"Content view\" width=\"528\" height=\"600\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>The loading view presented can be any SwiftUI view. The idea with this sample app is that the background color matches between the loading view and the launch screen setting. This requires creating a new color asset in Xcode for the color to be shared. This is necessary because in order to specify the Launch Screen Background Color in the Info.plist it must be a named asset. So in the Assets of the Xcode project select Editor -> Add New Asset -> Color Set (or select a Color Set from the + button in the lower left of the Asset panel. </p>\n<p>Name the color as desired and configure it to your needs. In the sample project the color is named “blueAssetColor” and it’s just the standard predefined “systemBlue” You can not use the predefined color names in the info.plist.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Screenshot 2023-05-03 at 18.24.21.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/5806276b8a.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023 05 03 at 18 24 21\" width=\"684\" height=\"427\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Next you need to tell Xcode to use this color as the background for your launch screen. Navigate to the info.plist by selecting the project in the Project Navigation, selecting the target for the app and the info pane in the editor. Find the item for Launch Screen and add an item within that group for Background Color entering the asset color you created earlier. In our sample project this value is “blueAssetColor”  There may be an item under Launch Screen when you first expand the item in the info editor labeled “UILaunchScreen” you can delete this entry.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Screenshot 2023-05-03 at 18.26.17.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/2d1565f30a.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023 05 03 at 18 26 17\" width=\"926\" height=\"369\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>With these steps completed the your app should launch with a blank launch screen and the background color will be the one you have specified here.</p>\n<p>The loading view can be virtually any SwiftUI view as long as the background color matches the launch screen color. The trick is to have your UI elements fade in over time. The code below shows how to use an animation to fade in the UI over two seconds. The first animation in the code is just to rotate an image on the loading view to indicate the app is working. The fade in animation is setup on the onAppear block later in the code.</p>\n<p><img title=\"loading_view-4.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/ae459cffd5.png\" alt=\"Loading view 4\" width=\"680\" height=\"1279\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>The end result is a loading screen that look like the following: </p>\n<p><img title=\"Screenshot 2023-05-03 at 18.52.53.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/45e1d8e967.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023 05 03 at 18 52 53\" width=\"307\" height=\"609\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>All the elements in yellow will fade in over the blue background. The fish image will also rotate as it is faded into view. The loading view is just standard SwiftUI and could be any view you like. Once the view model reports it’s <em>ready, </em>the app will transition to the main UI view and the user can get to work.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gitlab.com/patrickmcconnell/swiftui-launch-screen\">The full source for a sample project is available via GitLab</a> This approach may or may not apply to your projects but it does show a different way to think about Launch Screens.

				"content_text": "<p>One of the perks of self-employment, probably the biggest one, is being able to use your time as you see fit. So feeling like I needed a mental health day in the mountains I took a nice long hike on Thursday.</p>\n<p>The temperature started at around 45º but it was going to warm up with sunny skies. It did eventually reach 65º.  I was probably underdressed for the start in shorts and a shirt but I always say you need to dress for the weather you want. I’m not foolish so I do carry extra layers in case that doesn’t work out.</p>\n<p>One of the ways I decide to where to hike is looking at my past GPS tracks and look for missing segments. This is just one handy feature of having OCD. I have long had a gap in the Overlook Trail between Overlook Mountain and the Devils Kitchen. I’ve done this trail from both ends many times but not hiked the whole distance between the two trailheads with a GPS. Yes, I did walk the trail from Devils Kitchen to the Fire Tower on Overlook many years ago pre-GPS but that doesn’t count for GPS enabled OCD. I decided to rectify this glaring omission.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_2041.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/afc5ffecbd.png\" alt=\"IMG 2041\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>I started this walk from the Northeast end at the trailhead in the <a href=\"https://catskillcenter.org/platte-clove-preserve\">Platte Cove Preserve.</a> In peak season it’s difficult, if not impossible, to park at the preserve due to the waterfalls accessible via a few short hikes. On this weekday spring morning I was only the second car here.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_2045.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/4b48adcee0.png\" alt=\"IMG 2045\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Having visited the falls here several times I made good time heading through the preserve to where it connects to the the Devils Path heading towards the Devils Kitchen Lean-to. It was one of those days where you seem to have boundless energy and I made good time.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_2049.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/bfa93183f9.png\" alt=\"IMG 2049\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>At the junction to the Devils Path is the first of many old bluestone quarries to be seen along this route. In the 19th century much of this area was dedicated to extracting bluestone and supplying it to local cities for their sidewalks and other use. Today the quarries are mostly used by rock stacking and chair building aficionados. </p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_2051.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/dc0d9969ec.png\" alt=\"IMG 2051\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>It’s interesting to poke around these areas to see how widespread the quarry work was. I suspect many hikers walk past much of this without even noticing. Nature has a way of reclaiming these areas and unlike other quarries that tend to leave huge holes in the ground, these are more surface level and little remains to be seen but stack of rock and a few larger pieces of stone that look ready for market but never made it out of the woods.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_2059.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/440edac755.png\" alt=\"IMG 2059\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>A short distance from where the preserve trails join the Devils Path is the Devils Kitchen lean-to. This is great camping spot being situated right on a creek. The lean-to has seen better days and the lean in this case is from the structure tilting to the right quite a bit.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_2063.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/f1503302bf.png\" alt=\"IMG 2063\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Further along the trail is a larger quarry. It has some nice views out to the Hudson River. <img title=\"IMG_2065.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/10601e2526.png\" alt=\"IMG 2065\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>This quarry is on a spur trail off the Devils Path that parallels the trail for about a half mile. There was extensive work done here long ago and it’s interesting to see and imagine all the work happening in these now quiet woods. While you may feel a long way from civilization at this point, the Devils Path was originally a road so the quarry would have been well situated to get the stone to market,.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_2070.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/fc00824027.png\" alt=\"IMG 2070\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>This section of trail is also a designated bike trail and for long stretches the grade is gentle and it’s not your typical Catskill trail that reminds you more of a stream bed than trail. A mile or two after the quarry spur trail is the trail to Echo Lake. The area around the lake is a bit too popular and any time I’ve visited it was a bit trampled over. I decided to skip it for today. </p>\n<p>In another mile or so the trail begins to climb but not too aggressively. The trail skirts the edges of Overlook mountain winding around to the area most often accessed via the southwestern trailhead on Meads Road across from the <a href=\"https://kagyuktd.org/#visit\">KTD Monestary.</a> The Monestary itself is worth visiting if you’re passing through that end of the woods. </p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_2077.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/bdbc0c023a.png\" alt=\"IMG 2077\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>As you wind around and climb to the peak of Overlook Mountain you can begin to make out the tower above the trees (yes, it’s in that picture above.) This area is also notorious for rattlesnakes but I didn’t see any on this day in spite of the warm sun that they normally enjoy. Yes, the <a href=\"http://www.catskillmountaineer.com/animals-snakes.html\">Catskills (and parts of the Adirondacks) do have a rattlesnake population</a>.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_2078.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/384e4c873b.png\" alt=\"IMG 2078\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>I’ve been to this tower many times and while the view from the tower is great I always enjoy the stone ledge views that most certainly led to this mountain getting its name. The view above is of Ashokan Reservoir with the village of Woodstock nestled in the trees as well.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_2088.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/ab96b6edea.png\" alt=\"IMG 2088\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>These rock ledges in the Catskills have long been popular and many prior visitors have carved their names into the rock. Here are samples dating back to 1892 and there are many earlier carvings as well. </p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_2090.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/8ae1d574fd.png\" alt=\"IMG 2090\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>The tower was looking sharp against the bright blue sky and people were picnicking at the base on this near perfect day. </p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_2100.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/1c73bf7622.png\" alt=\"IMG 2100\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Heading back I detoured briefly into the ruins just below the peak. The <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/overlook-mountain-house\">ruins were to be a hotel</a> but were never fully completed. They replaced earlier iterations of the hotel that burned. Always fun to wander and a great spot for photos.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_2103.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/0d70e9f217.png\" alt=\"IMG 2103\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>On the return trip, just below the summit a spooked a deer who was probably drinking at the stream as it crossed the trail. The deer didn’t run off and probably wanted me to move along so it could get back to doing deer things. </p>\n<p>The walk back was scenic but uneventful. It is one of those rare Catskill hikes where the terrain underfoot is mellow enough that you can glance off the trail. Evidence of more quarries are seen if you look. At one point I spotted what looked like a bluestone stair tread, a piece of stone about one foot by four feet. I then found several more similar stones just off the trail. It’s not clear if this was a remnant of a structure or materials that were going from the quarries to a building somewhere far off. Being stone they were as good as new and if I had the means I would have gladly carted them home and put them to use.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Screenshot 2023-04-22 at 12.41.11.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/1a12485059.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023 04 22 at 12 41 11\" width=\"599\" height=\"412\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>This round trip on a perfect spring day covered 10.6 miles with a gentle ascent of over 1,400 feet. Now that section of trail is filled in. Time to find more gaps and get back out there.</p>\n",

The snow has all but cleared out at the 2,000’ level though some of the north facing peaks had snow hanging on at what appeared to be around 3,000’.  This area around the lake and rail trail lies at about 2,000’ feet so the only remaining snow was in deep shaded pockets.

The pictures won’t do it justice but if you spend any time in the woods you know how relaxing it is to spend a few minutes at these spots.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_2020.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/ce6e3d4833.png\" alt=\"IMG 2020\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_2034.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/75b72196a6.png\" alt=\"IMG 2034\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>The lake was reflecting the bright sunlight and it seems it’s time to apply the sunscreen again for the next 8 months.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_2036.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/757f43568b.png\" alt=\"IMG 2036\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Not much new ground covered today but I did come across one interesting spot I’ve seen before that I don’t recall getting photos of. As this area is now largely a state campground and day use area there are many campsites, picnic spots and other facilities. One spot has several fire pits that appear to have been left to the elements in the woods. Not clear why these would not be cleared and used as any time I’ve visited in season the place is full.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_2028.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/bc90bdd834.png\" alt=\"IMG 2028\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>In this second shot there are at least 3 abandoned fire pits if you look hard enough.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_2030.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/9edd708498.png\" alt=\"IMG 2030\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>7.5 miles hiked and a whopping 336 feet of elevation gained. Much fresh air and sun was had.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Screenshot 2023-04-09 at 18.11.53.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/159b7ae3f9.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023 04 09 at 18 11 53\" width=\"598\" height=\"293\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>After 3 weeks of lingering cold symptoms (not covid but annoying regardless) I finally got out into the woods. It snowed a few inches last night at the house but I suspected the hills would have more and I was correct. I probably bit off more than I needed to so soon after not leaving the couch for a few weeks but I survived.</p>\n<p>The Mount Riga State Park is a Connecticut park right at the northwest corner where Massachusetts, New York and Connecticut come together. This hike would have me park my car (or more correctly “cah\") in Mass., snowshoe through Conn. and summit in NY</p>\n<p>Since I was sure I was not in shape for a stressful trip I avoided the routes with a few steep climbs over peaks that I’ve done before and took the road trail. The road through the park is closed in the winter so it was a nice wide strip of fresh, heavy snow to trek though.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1998.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/4263f478c3.png\" alt=\"IMG 1998\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>The 2” of snow we got at home was 6-8” along the closed road and as I traveled up to elevation it was 10-12” This was a journey with no real destination.

This snow won’t last long as there was little in the surrounding areas at lower elevations and temperatures are rising, slowly week to week. The snow clinging to the trees was falling the entire trip and I am hopeful mud season starts soon enough, as bad as that sounds. This was a very pretty trip in the woods but I’m ready for spring.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Had a break from work on Friday and the temps were hovering around 50º for a bit so I needed to get out in the woods. I didn’t have time for an all day trip so I headed back to the Pittsfield State Forest and its web of tangled ATV/Hiking trails. </p>\n<p>The trails in this forest are accessed from several different trailheads so I figured I’d try a new approach. The first trailhead had private signs marking the road barrier. I had my doubts if that was a legit warning as the road is still on the map as a public right of way but since there is another trailhead about a mile away I decided to try that alternative.</p>\n<p>The official road ends at about 1,400’ of elevation and there was only a bit of old snow on the road as it entered the woods. The wind was picking up and the 50º temperature was not going to last.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1988.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/69f63d72d8.png\" alt=\"IMG 1988\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Due to this still being a “road” on smaps both sides had private property for about 3/4 mile before getting into the actual state land. There was quite a bit of evidence of logging including run down trucks, equipment and rough barn buildings. </p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1989.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/eadf08fa1a.png\" alt=\"IMG 1989\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>After entering the state forest section the snow was deeper and there was some ice on the trail. This trail is also for ATV/Snowmobiles so it is basically a rutted track in spots sometimes 5 feet or more wide and a few feet deep. This does not give the meltwater anywhere to go so it freezes into a bobsled run in spots. Nothing that can’t be walked around and the snow/ice was melting quickly.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1990.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/518c4ca3cd.png\" alt=\"IMG 1990\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>There are so many intersecting trails for all sorts of purposes that you need to keep an eye on the map or GPS. You never get so far off into the wilderness that you will be lost for long but you could easily come out of the woods miles from where you parked.</p>\n<p>I spotted this tiny birdhouse like item hanging from a tree at the junction to the Tower Mountain trail. The whole thing might be 3 inches tall. No clue what it is. You always see interesting things in the woods if you stop and look.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1993.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/c4bc96b35b.png\" alt=\"IMG 1993\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Tower Mountain is named for the former firetower that once stood on its peak. The tower is long gone but a sign remains to mark the spot.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1994.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/8645ecbccc.png\" alt=\"IMG 1994\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Upon reaching the summit of Tower Mountain, the wind was really picking up and the temperature had dropped from the elevation gain as well as the front apparently moving in. I elected to not go much further so I picked a trail that would circle back to the car via the <a href=\"https://taconichikingclub.org/taconic-crest-trail\">Taconic Crest Trail</a>. This trail intersects the various ATV tracks all through the woods up here but is in better shape than the machine trafficked trails due to it being lightly used and only by hikers. The Taconic Crest Trail straddles the border between NY/VT &amp; MA for over 30 miles along the ridge of the Taconic range. I’ve walked most of this trail in bits and pieces. It’s a very nice quiet trail that visits some interesting spots. One day it would be nice to make a weekend trip of the entire trail.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1995.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/f98e7805f8.png\" alt=\"IMG 1995\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Covered just under 3.5 miles with 630 feet of climbing. While micro-spikes would have been helpful in spots there was nothing that could not be avoided. The biggest issue besides the wind gusts was the rate of melting snow causing it be very wet and some cold feet.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Screenshot 2023-02-12 at 6.38.17 PM.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/34046ccf05.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023 02 12 at 6 38 17 PM\" width=\"600\" height=\"514\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>After several hikes in this area, I’ve only scratched the surface what’s here. I’ll be back again soon.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Saturday I wanted to do something a bit more challenging that my recent local hikes but not too technical. On days like these I tend to revisit a favorite hike so I decided to hike Hunter Mountain from Sprucetown Road. I’ve done this hike dozens of time so I told myself I’ll just walk up until I feel like turning around. I don’t need yet another picture of the fire tower on top of the mountain.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1978.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/e5af5f67c6.png\" alt=\"IMG 1978\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>There was some snow on the trail but it had been heavily trafficked recently so snowshoes were not needed. I slipped on my spikes to ensure some good traction and headed out. I did strap the snowshoes to my pack in case I needed them higher up.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1980.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/a40ee526cf.png\" alt=\"IMG 1980\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>It wasn’t too cold but most importantly the sun finally made an appearance.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1979.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/63eba7432e.png\" alt=\"IMG 1979\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Can’t recall the last hike I was able to see my shadow.</p>\n<p>I walked the old road/horse trail towards the tower at a steady pace, relaxed that I had no real goal other than to just be out in the woods for the afternoon.  </p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1981.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/6458bfc333.png\" alt=\"IMG 1981\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>After a few miles of walking I reached the spring just below the John Robb lean-to and as usual it was still pumping out water into the old barrel. This must be one of the most reliable springs in the Catskills. I ventured past the former site of the lean-to and the trail to the newer one. The new one is in a far better spot a few yards of the trail but there are still some views looking back towards Rusk Mountain from the old lean-to site.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1984.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/5617a6cc38.png\" alt=\"IMG 1984\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>I’m now at the age where I’be been hiking these mountains so long I can remember back when there were views in many spots that are now blocked from tree growth.</p>\n<p>I reached the turn off to the Colonels Chair, a trail I have never bothered to hike and after today I can still say I’ve never hiked that trail. Normally when I head out to Hunter I want to get to the top or complete the full loop and I don’t want to invest the 2 plus miles out and back to visit the ski slopes that launch from Colonels Chair. </p>\n<p>I did start out briefly on the spur to the slopes but after it descended a few hundred feet I decided I really didn’t want to climb the amount that would be required on the return trip. I can now say I’ve hiked about a quarter mile of that trail and one day I’ll finish it in my quest to fill in the map.</p>\n<p>After the quick aborted trip down the spur I decided it would be ok to just head down to the car, so I did.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1982.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/3c8ab234b5.png\" alt=\"IMG 1982\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>It’s always surprising how steadily this trail climbs often taking more out of you than you recall from the last visit. In that case the way down is always far quicker and I was back to the car in about an hour covering over 3 miles. Not as quick as a few of the backcountry skiers I encountered but respectable for foot travel.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Screenshot 2023-01-31 at 4.10.44 PM.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/49721bf08b.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023 01 31 at 4 10 44 PM\" width=\"563\" height=\"359\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>A around 6 miles covered with 1,500+ feet of climbing. But most importantly I saw the sun.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>On Saturday I continued the quest to explore any and all local wilderness areas. I discovered there was a fire tower in a forest near Rhinebeck and being a big fan of fire towers I put this on the agenda. Nearby were a few other parks/preserves so I kept my options open to visit another spot, time permitting.</p>\n<p>About 30 minutes from me is <a href=\"http://ferncliffforest.org/\">Ferncliff Forest</a> and my maps showed a fire tower and several shelters for camping there. This looked like an interesting place to explore on yet another dreary gray January day.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1939.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/9a11a44da8.png\" alt=\"IMG 1939\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>A short walk from the parking area leads to a small lake/pond with 3 shelters. According to the website these shelters are all free to use but a reservation is needed. If you’re looking for a quick walk to an overnight camp spot these might be helpful. The forest is not far off the <a href=\"https://empiretrail.ny.gov/\">Empire State Trail</a> so these might also be useful for those on a bike tour. I’ve often thought of riding down to NYC or Long Island to visit friends and family so maybe these would come in handy one day.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1940.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/2881af199a.png\" alt=\"IMG 1940\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Next to another shelter, the beavers have been active and this was not the only spot showing signs of their work.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1946.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/0c1052b537.png\" alt=\"IMG 1946\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Another pond appears to be forming further along the trail due to the beaver dam blocking a stream.</p>\n<p>This forest allows mountain biking and it looks like bikers have taken that to heart. There are a lot of trails and they almost seem redundant in spots if you’re walking. There are trails right next to trails and some of the trails are clearly routed for single track fun, winding back and forth through the woods in ways you might not create a trail for walking.</p>\n<p>Not a problem as the trails are all in good shape but it does create the need to carry a map or have your GPS handy as there are many trails and it’s easy to get confused. My GPS didn’t even show all the trails here and it appears the map provided on the web site does not either. You’re not likely to get very lost as the forest is surrounded by roads and not all that large that you would find yourself trapped in a wilderness survival situation.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1941.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/9075a206e9.png\" alt=\"IMG 1941\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>As I mentioned, there are several different shelters and they are even different styles. There are a few traditional NYS style lean-tos.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1943.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/7d15085b2a.png\" alt=\"IMG 1943\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>There are also some other interesting shelter designs. This one looks like it would be great for cold weather camping but I’m not sure how much wood you would find nearby.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1949.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/730046f9df.png\" alt=\"IMG 1949\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>After wandering the woods for a while I decided to seek out the tower I’d read about. It is situated in the middle of the forest on a high point as would befit a fire tower but it’s also quite a tall tower.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1952.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/5861fe9900.png\" alt=\"IMG 1952\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>That height gives you some great 360º views of the Catskills, Taconics and local farms. </p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1953.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/c3abe0182c.png\" alt=\"IMG 1953\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1947.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/a5c83d2b4a.png\" alt=\"IMG 1947\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>As this is one of those local adventures you’re never far from civilization and on some of the trails you are actually right next to the road, in this case route 103/River Road. I only saw one car pass as I walked this stretch of trail for about a half mile so the road is lightly trafficked.</p>\n<p>It’s easy to create a few different routes through the forest and I ended up doing about 3.7 miles with a total ascent of 265 feet. If you’re looking for a low stress way to visit a fire tower and get some great views this is it.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Screenshot 2023-01-23 at 4.58.36 PM.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/ea0acff472.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023 01 23 at 4 58 36 PM\" width=\"600\" height=\"580\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>After I got back to my car I removed my muddy boots and started to head home. I figured I would take a scenic route along the river. I returned to River Road which seemed to promise something interesting. I had traveled less than a mile when I came upon a sign for <a href=\"https://www.scenichudson.org/explore-the-valley/scenic-hudson-parks/poets-walk-park/\">Poet’s Walk</a>. I had seen this when pouring over my maps looking for targets to visit so I figured I would pull in for a look.</p>\n<p>It’s only about about a mile, one way, down to the river from the parking area so I put my muddy shoes back on and headed out. I was quickly greeted by a woman from Scenic Hudson who runs the park. They are looking for someone to be a gatekeeper, closing the gate after hours. It did sound like my kind of community service but it’s too far a drive for me to do that every day. It is a paying gig so if you happen to be local look them up.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1966.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/f5dcf52c4d.png\" alt=\"IMG 1966\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>The trails here wander from open meadows with distant Catksill views to wooded paths crossing over a few streams.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1962.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/e5347697e1.png\" alt=\"IMG 1962\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>There are some nice examples of rustic architecture and furniture.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1968.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/a9e94dbe21.png\" alt=\"IMG 1968\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>I imagine this place gets very crowded in the warmer months where people can spend time just lounging about in the fields.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1969.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/9d4aa47021.png\" alt=\"IMG 1969\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>There are a number of stream crossings on the woods trails. The recent wetness created some slippery footing in that classic Hudson River Valley mud/clay soil. Micro-spikes would have helped in spots. It was very slick.</p>\n<p>The trail basically creates a loop either way you go and eventually you end at the river overlooking the train tracks to the mighty Hudson and the Catskills beyond.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1971.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/4ac4567207.png\" alt=\"IMG 1971\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>At the location called “Summer House” there is a gazebo and some other seating. The other destination near the river on the trail is called “The Lookout” both are clearly marked and very close to each other. The Lookout sits on a hill and again there are a a few benches to sit on.</p>\n<p>This quick walk added about 2.4 miles with 170 of “climbing” </p>\n<p><img title=\"Screenshot 2023-01-23 at 5.21.37 PM.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/e13dee9e1b.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023 01 23 at 5 21 37 PM\" width=\"599\" height=\"404\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Not a bad way to spend another gray Saturday. Always impressed with these preserves or little pockets of wilderness. They’re not always the same as climbing one of the high peaks but sometimes you get your wilderness in different ways. I’m glad these sorts of places are here. Thanks for people like <a href=\"https://www.scenichudson.org/\">Scenic Hudson</a> for creating these resources.</p>\n",

The map showed a waterfall and I expected to see it flowing due to the recent rains. </p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1916.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/c705a80297.png\" alt=\"IMG 1916\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>The trail can be accessed from two locations, one on NYS route 144 and another just off the Main Street up Madison Avenue and situated next to a church retreat center. I chose to park at the later location.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1917.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/4ee40e49ce.png\" alt=\"IMG 1917\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Upon entering the woods it is immediately apparent this was a well traveled road at some point. Stone walls and a few foundations are quickly spotted.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1920.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/1f235c4f25.png\" alt=\"IMG 1920\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>One section of walkway is quickly reached in a low area. No danger of water today but a light dusting of snow on the smooth boards can be slippery.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1918.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/32a380f9ea.png\" alt=\"IMG 1918\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>At the end of the more pronounced woods road a junction is reached at the Hannacroix Creek. The creek itself is not very exciting, your standard creek through the woods, but just off to your left is a small trail that leads to the waterfall noted on the map. The falls are not terribly high but still provide some scenic bang for their buck and were running well from the recent rains.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1923.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/b009db9f61.png\" alt=\"IMG 1923\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>No swimming signs are present every few yards but I expect they are often disregarded in the warmer months. This looks like one of those spots that is best visited in the off season to avoid the masses.</p>\n<p>Continuing back on the aptly named Paper Mill Trail you soon come to the namesake ruins of the Croswell-Parsons Paper Mill</p>\n<p> <img title=\"IMG_1926.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/62b4ac54b2.png\" alt=\"IMG 1926\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>The rest of the trail wanders up and down a bit until you reach the other parking area along route 144. From there you can return via a slightly different route or cross the road to another short trail leading to the Hudson.</p>\n<p>Along the way to the river, more ruins are spotted including this chimney up on  a slight rise</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1927.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/3e9b6f31b5.png\" alt=\"IMG 1927\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Another sight is this truss bridge constructed from recycled plastic. I guess this is better than letting the plastic not rot in landfills. It can resist rotting here on the trail and provide a way to cross the tidal stream.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1929.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/d042e16b5a.png\" alt=\"IMG 1929\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>While we are not experiencing anything like a normal winter weather wise, it was still too cold to linger long at the rivers edge and there really isn’t much to see once you reach the river.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1930.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/28cbd00d0f.png\" alt=\"IMG 1930\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Just a traditional New York winters day with gray upon gray. Snow might improve this scene if I’m being honest.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1931.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/d5f9b82b4b.png\" alt=\"IMG 1931\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>I headed back to the car by way of a slightly different set of trails. My apps were all over the board with mileage for this one. The phone shows one thing and the watch another. This was about 3.5 miles give or take and only few hundred feet of climbing.  The screenshot below is from a new to me promising app called Footpath. I am a long time GaiaGPS user but they seem to be slow fixing things or adding new features since being acquired by Outside so I’m keeping my options open. If all else fails I still know how to use a map and compass.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_0184.JPG\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2023/4d748d2c9c.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 0184\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Heading out to a new local slice of wilderness is often a pleasant surprise and rarely disappoints. This is another such case. The scenery was pleasant and the walk was enough to get the blood pumping without straying too far from home.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I can’t say I’ve been working on the <a href=\"http://catskill-3500-club.org/peaks.php\">Catskill 3500</a> list as I’ve been hiking the list peaks for over 30 years and I’m still not done. Let’s call it nibbling on the list. I sometimes get the idea to do something foolish like visit one of the peaks I’ve yet to summit. So today it being in the 50s at home I figured it was a good day to check off my 3rd of the winter peaks, Panther Mountain. Mistakes were made.</p>\n<p>I left home a bit late but my gps app said it was only 3 miles to the Panther Summit with about 1,600 of climbing. The numbers were off and really didn’t reflect the level of difficulty. Last week this area received over 24” of snow and most of that snow remains at elevation. The lower elevations are a slippery icy mess from all the traffic over the past holiday week. I saw more than one group of smart hikers turn back at the first of the steeper patches as they didn’t have proper footgear. </p>\n<p>The first mile plus was either ice of well packed snow that only required microspikes to navigate. Still there were areas where footing was not great and my feet would often slip on the snow now warming enough to become soft slush. This would be a theme for the full trip.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1895.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2022/79c96cbab0.png\" alt=\"IMG 1895\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>The first vantage point is the highly trafficked Giant Ledge but even before the ledges there are some good off season views at the Burroughs Range through the trees. The drop from the backside of slide down to Cornell is very obvious from this vantage point. I remember one of our death march hikes when we were younger and more foolish when we dropped off Slide into a deep snow drift on what would then need to be a one way trip down to Woodland Valley.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1899.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2022/3ac4f9ec27.png\" alt=\"IMG 1899\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>There is a reason Giant Ledge is so frequently visited and its views like these. Very few locations let you see so many Catskill peaks in one panorama. The sun did break out later only improving the view.</p>\n<p>The path up to Giant ledge, while slippery, was fairly well packed and had not softened as much as the col to Panther or the Panther summit. I only started to descend a few yards off Giant Ledge before it became clear that snowshoes were more appropriate to avoid postholing every third step. Snowshoes are both a blessing and a curse as they allow you to float over some obstacles but their general unwieldy size often make them tricky to maneuver in tight spaces or the typical Catskill steep rock climbs.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1896.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2022/0ab53671df.png\" alt=\"IMG 1896\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>At this point I was regretting not bringing quite enough water or snacks a decision I would regret later. My late start was also becoming an issue made worse by the slow slippery travel. I met another hiker who called this a “technical day” and that sounds right to me.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1907.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2022/c2790416fc.png\" alt=\"IMG 1907\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>I didn’t recall much of a view from Panther on my past visits but I was able to get some shots through the trees. I wanted to reach the summit by 2:30PM in order to have 2 hours to get back to the car and I was already about 15 minutes behind schedule.</p>\n<p>News of the warming trend clearly not reached this elevation and I was wet, almost out of water and hungry. I drank most of my water, ate a Larabar and added another layer. What I could not do was linger as the sun would set in less than 2 hours and I figured that’s how long the trip down would take</p>\n<p>My feet were soaked through my “waterproof” boots and standing still for more than a minute would make this painfully obvious. Even catching my breath was not ideal at this point as I was wet and needed to get moving and warm again. So I began the walk down.</p>\n<p>At one point I tripped over my snowshoes one too many times and decided to take them off. I was too tired and they were not helping as much as I would like. I put the spikes back on an made better time. Yes I added a few post holes but I assure this trail was already cratered before I got there. Every step was twice as difficult as it would have been on a clear trail. It was a crapshoot if your foot would finish where you placed it. The ice, slush and soft snow made this portion of the hike an adventure.</p>\n<p>I made better time without the snowshoes but I’ve rarely felt this worn out with half of the hike still left to complete. Hopefully the snack, water and heading back down would warm me up and give the enough fuel to finish before dark. In the end, it did. It was not the most enjoyable trip down but once I warmed up it went ok.</p>\n<p>As I got down off the other side of Giant Ledge, on the way back to the car, I saw another hiker heading up. I assumed I would be the last person on the mountain today as the sun was only minutes from setting. I asked the hiker how far he was going and he said Panther. He clearly looked like he knew what he was doing and I enquired if he had lights and he pointed as some fancy led array of lights on his chest and mentioned he had just done the entire Burroughs range this morning. I remember when I was younger and stronger too. </p>\n<p>At the blue/yellow trail intersection marking the last 3/4 mile remaining to the parking area, I changed my wet hat and gloves for a fresh dry set and this too gave me a boost. I also placed a flashlight in my pocket. The sun had set but twilight was doing enough. Good thing too as the flashlight died as soon as I tried to use it to light up a tricky patch. I have a few other lights but at this point I was very close to being done so I really didn’t want to take off my pack one more time to change lights. The only point I really needed illumination was to check out in the log book at the trailhead.</p>\n<p>Gaia GPS said this was 3 miles up to Panther. My Apple Watch logged about 8 miles traveled and at least 500 feet more elevation that Gaia reports. The final (lesser) stats for the day show 6.5 miles traveled and 1,816 feet of climbing. It felt like at least 50% more due to the conditions and probably a few too many holiday cookies over the past week.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Screenshot 2022-12-30 at 9.08.54 PM.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2022/dd475e7014.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022 12 30 at 9 08 54 PM\" width=\"600\" height=\"566\" border=\"0\" /> </p>\n<p><img title=\"Screenshot 2022-12-30 at 9.08.37 PM.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2022/378535630e.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022 12 30 at 9 08 37 PM\" width=\"570\" height=\"414\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p> </p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Headed out today to see how much snow fell in the Catskills from the last storm. Turns out it varied widely. At lower elevations there were spots in the southern Catskills around Palenville that had no snow at all. Areas in the northern Catskills around Windham appeared to have almost two feet of fresh snow.</p>\n<p>Everywhere that snow had fallen it was heavy and wet so it was still clinging to the trees as the sun had not made an appearance until today. It makes for a white winter wonderland.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1879.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2022/49fc22a36b.png\" alt=\"IMG 1879\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>I wanted to get out on my snowshoes and since I haven’t done any snowshoeing since last season, I didn’t want to do too much.

This area had about 10-12 inches of snow off trail. The snowshoes were probably overkill as the trail was broken all the way to the falls. </p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1878.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2022/f3424a2ef6.png\" alt=\"IMG 1878\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Turns out the actual falls are probably more photogenic when they are not covered in snow but the whole area was spectacular today.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1868.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2022/ce6a2404f5.png\" alt=\"IMG 1868\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1875.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2022/1c89ec3ee1.png\" alt=\"IMG 1875\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Only two miles for the day and a 230’ ascent winding through the saplings bent over from the weight of the snow and ice. By the time I headed back to the car the sun was breaking through so I suspect the trees will be freed of their burden shortly and spring back upright.</p>\n<p><img title=\"UntitledImage.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2022/c817e1fb95.png\" alt=\"UntitledImage\" width=\"485\" height=\"600\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>After clearing the  heavy wet snow from the driveway this morning, I spent most of the day coding on a MUD. </p>\n<p>This scratches the itch to make something game-like without getting bogged down with graphics. I can get right into the parts I enjoy creating.</p>\n<p>Its fun to take yet another stab at socket programming and message parsing. It’s also rewarding to get a world up and running relatively quickly where you control all the rules.</p>\n<p>I had some old code but, as is always the case, it was bad. I don’t know what that other me was thinking. I started from scratch this time. It’s written in Go since I’ve been working with that for the day job lately and Go works well with this sort of project. Sometimes you want to learn a new language or framework and sometimes you just want to make something with comfortable tools. Today was the later.</p>\n<p>In the past I’ve created these sorts of things in the traditional way with text files for data storage but for this project I added Postgres for my storage layer. It’s overkill but the whole project is overkill. No one is going to play this but it’s fun to hack on something that’s completely of my design.</p>\n<p>Here is the world in all it’s glory after a few hours:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">look</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Room 1 - (19c4361b-f382-43e7-b708-03b5d73b3454)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The first room</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Exits: East</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Say Hello mud!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">You said 'Hello mud!'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I even took the time to create admin tools to work with the database. So I can just run migrations from my admin tool or seed the database quickly.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I worked on the code in <a href=\"https://nova.app\">Nova</a>, the Mac editor from Panic and it’s very good. It is very Mac like and extensible. While it seems most people use it for web dev there are some decent plug-ins for Go. I can do most everything I do in VS Code in Nova except debugging. I did have to swap over to VS Code a few times since its so easy to debug there. </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The best part of this project so far is getting into the flow. I find it less likely that I can get into that mental state when I’m working on a project consulting for others. It takes a lot to get up to speed and if I didn’t create the architecture or requirements I find it slows me down. When I do my own projects I am far, far more likely to just bang away and find 4 hours have passed. That’s the part of this work that is most enjoyable. When the code seemingly writes itself. If you were to stop and look over your own shoulder you would probably have no clue what is going on but the person in that trance like flow does know what’s going on and it works. </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The only downside to that state of mind is being interrupted. Even a simple question that breaks the spell can be far more irritating than it really should be.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This project amuses me and it’s in good enough shape to shelve it and come back when that inevitably happens. Of course by that time older me with think today’s me quite a silly person for some choices I made here but for now I’m content.</p>\n<p> </p>\n",

Today’s light snow made another visit to North Lake an easy pick.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1835.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2022/a5ad466110.png\" alt=\"IMG 1835\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>The campground is located in Americas very first vacation destination and the region gave birth to one of our country’s first art movements, the Hudson River School.  Artists from the region began painting the wilderness which made this region an early destination for vacationers prior to the civil war and up until the middle of the 20th century. Naturally, people still visit this region but at it’s peak it was the destination in the young nation.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1831.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2022/c9541d3ed8.png\" alt=\"IMG 1831\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Several grand hotels were located on the land that is now occupied by the campground and adjacent state forests. In order to cater to their visitors desires to see the Catskill wilderness a large network of trails and woods roads were created. Many of these trails remain today.</p>\n<p>These hotels and the region were so popular at their height that railroad lines were constructed to get to the hotels. The depot of the Delaware &amp; Ulster Railroad has been restored and is at the start of the <a href=\"https://townofhuntergov.com/kaaterskill-rail-trail/\">Kaaterskill Rail Trail</a></p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1819.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2022/22da27e328.png\" alt=\"IMG 1819\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Today’s walk began at the historic train depot and follows the rail trail for over a mile before coming to Kaaterskill Falls. This is the only rail trail I’ve visited that still has many wooden ties left in place. You need to watch your step, particularly when it’s wet or icy.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1821.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2022/cb23504478.png\" alt=\"IMG 1821\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>After about 1.5 miles the trail comes to the site of the former Laurel House Hotel and an observation platform for the Kaaterskill Falls. Over the past few years these falls have become very popular and often feel like they may be in danger of being loved to death. It’s easy to see why as you can park and walk a 1/2 mile to an amazing view.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1858.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2022/c5df69c73b.png\" alt=\"IMG 1858\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>After leaving the falls, there are a number of trails and old roads that wander through the woods. With no particular destination in mind I followed the old rail line farther until I reached the lakes themselves.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1837.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2022/ba634cd093.png\" alt=\"IMG 1837\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>If current conditions persist, in a few weeks the lakes will be busy with snowmobiles and ice fishermen. There was still a bit of open water today. I had the park virtually to myself, seeing only a handful of other people.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1832.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2022/3b25595fde.png\" alt=\"IMG 1832\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>For over a century people have visited these woods and scenes like this. </p>\n<p>At the east end of the lakes is the former site of the original great hotel of the Catskills, the Catskill Mountain house. The original drive to the site remains as well as remnants of the gates and assorted out buildings</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1842.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2022/67ca4ecef6.png\" alt=\"IMG 1842\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1840.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2022/5e169c671d.png\" alt=\"IMG 1840\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Guests would arrive up this road to the hotel situated on a cliff overlooking the Hudson Valley. The hotel stood for 140 years before becoming a hazard and being removed with a controlled burn by the DEC in 1963.</p>\n<p>At the former hotel site, there are several displays that show what it looked like along with images of the other nearby hotels.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1846.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2022/a18cdeb9eb.png\" alt=\"IMG 1846\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>It’s possible to visit a few hotel sites in this region and back in the woods a bit to the west of the Mountain House is the site of the Kaaterskill Hotel. That hotel is also long gone but the area still shows the old roads and foundations where it stood.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1824.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2022/b106391c55.png\" alt=\"IMG 1824\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>It’s always great to see the woods transformed by the first snows.

I’m not opposed to using a framework but I was hoping to go over how to implement it yourself before taking that shortcut. Not a knock on the tutorial, which is very good, but more a statement about how my mind works and how I can never finish these sorts of projects.</p>\n<p>I’ve built these types of games myself from scratch before and I know how to create all the parts. Sometimes all it takes to scratch that “time to make a game” itch is do a few tutorials and fool around.</p>\n<p>Main reasons I never finish any of these projects are I overcomplicate it from the start and I always want to keep dependencies out of it. These two tend to go hand in hand.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the journey is the point and just reading, learning and messing with the code is the important thing anyway.

Most of them are old roads now used by ATVs and snowmobiles. There are foot trails mixed in and all of it can be hiked. The trails can get wet and muddy due to these vehicles but they allow lots of wandering and creating loops in the woods.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1809.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2022/a58702070b.png\" alt=\"IMG 1809\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>In some spots the trails are two lane superhighways through the woods. The location above had two lanes for about a half mile. I assume this is to avoid collisions but in many spots it’s so wet people have created more than two lanes.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1803.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2022/4d1be782ad.png\" alt=\"IMG 1803\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>The roads and trails create a network of paths but there are quite a lot of signs to help navigate, though they all differ.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1808.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2022/2b5beb0bf0.png\" alt=\"IMG 1808\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>One highlight of these woods is Twin Ponds. Two ponds hidden in the woods. The second twin and larger pond is just beyond those trees in the background on that slight rise.<img title=\"IMG_1811.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2022/026ffe6309.png\" alt=\"IMG 1811\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>The trails are intersected at a few points by the <a href=\"https://taconichikingclub.org/taconic-crest-trail\">Taconic Crest Trail</a>. This is more of a footpath and tends to be less wet than the ATV trails. </p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_1804.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2022/bda7b58cea.png\" alt=\"IMG 1804\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Today I started off Brickyard Road just off Route 20 but I've accessed this trail network from the parking areas on Route 20 and the Pittsfield side as well. The trails extend for miles and there are many access points. Makes for interesting wandering</p>\n<p>A dreary December day. 31º with a few flurries but still no real snow.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Screenshot 2022-12-04 at 12.55.34 PM.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2022/d9abc138ad.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022 12 04 at 12 55 34 PM\" width=\"274\" height=\"241\" border=\"0\" /><img title=\"Screenshot 2022-12-04 at 12.55.50 PM.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1998/2022/9368627973.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022 12 04 at 12 55 50 PM\" width=\"247\" height=\"503\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n",
